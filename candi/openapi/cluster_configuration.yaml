      General parameters of a cluster.

      Defines, for example, network and CRI parameters, control plane version, etc. Some parameters can be changed after the cluster is bootstrapped, during its operation.

      To change the `ClusterConfiguration` resource in a running cluster, run the following command:

      ```shell
      kubectl -n d8-system exec -ti deploy/deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller edit cluster-configuration

          - `Cloud` — a cluster deployed on the resources of a cloud infrastructure. This type implies that Deckhouse has access to the cloud infrastructure API for managing virtual machines.

          If `Automatic` is specified, then the control plane version is used, which is considered stable at the moment.
