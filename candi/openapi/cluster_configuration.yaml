      General parameters of a cluster.

      Defines, for example, network and CRI parameters, control plane version, etc. Some parameters can be changed after the cluster is bootstrapped, during its operation.

      To change the `ClusterConfiguration` resource in a running cluster, run the following command:

      ```shell
      kubectl -n d8-system exec -ti deploy/deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller edit cluster-configuration

          Kubernetes control plane version to use in a cluster.

          Changing a parameter in a running cluster will [automatically update](https://deckhouse.io/documentation/v1/modules/040-control-plane-manager/#version-control) the cluster's control plane version.

          If `Automatic` is specified, then the control plane version is used, which is considered stable at the moment. If the stable version of control plane is less than the maximum version that has ever been installed in the cluster, more than 1 minor version, then the version of the cluster will not be changed.
          The version may change when the minor version of the Deckhouse release is changed (see a corresponding release message).

          The parameters described in this section will be translated into the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` for all cluster nodes and Deckhouse components. This will result in HTTP(S) requests (curl, git, registry, etc.) to all resources not listed in the `noProxy` parameter being made through a proxy. Note that the `podSubnetCIDR` and `serviceSubnetCIDR` subnets, as well as the `clusterDomain` domain are added to `noProxy` automatically.

          > **Caution!** To avoid interfering with internal requests, make sure you list all the host subnets in the `noProxy` parameter.
