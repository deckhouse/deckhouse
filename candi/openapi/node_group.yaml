                        An overprovisioned node is a cluster node on which resources are reserved that are available at any time for scaling. The presence of such a node allows the cluster autoscaler not to wait for node initialization (which may take several minutes), but to immediately place a load on it.

                        The value can be an absolute number (for example, 2) or a percentage of desired nodes (for example, 10%). If a percentage is specified, the absolute number is calculated based on the percentage of the maximum number of nodes (the [maxPerZone](#nodegroup-v1-spec-cloudinstances-maxperzone) parameter) rounded down, but not less than one.

                        The approval mode for disruptive updates:
                        - `Manual` — disable automatic disruption approval; the alert will be displayed if disruption is needed. **Caution!** The `master` node group update mode must be `Manual` to avoid issues with draining.
                        - `Automatic` —  automatically approve disruption-involving updates.
                        - `RollingUpdate` — in this mode, a **new** node with new settings will be created; then, the old node will be deleted. Available only for cloud nodes.

                        If the `RollingUpdate` mode is not used, when updating, the node is first drained and then updated (rebooted) and put back into operation (uncordoned). Note that in this case, the cluster must have sufficient resources to accommodate the load while the node being updated is unavailable. In the `RollingUpdate` mode, the node is **replaced** by the updated node, i.e., an extra node appears in the cluster for the duration of the update. In cloud infrastructures, the `RollingUpdate` mode is convenient, for example, if there are no resources in the cluster to temporarily host the load from the node being updated.

                        The summary number of overprovisioned nodes for this `NodeGroup` in all [zones](#nodegroup-v1alpha2-spec-cloudinstances-zones).

                        An overprovisioned node is a cluster node on which resources are reserved that are available at any time for scaling. The presence of such a node allows the cluster autoscaler not to wait for node initialization (which may take several minutes), but to immediately place a load on it.

                        The value can be an absolute number (for example, 2) or a percentage of desired nodes (for example, 10%). If a percentage is specified, the absolute number is calculated based on the percentage of the maximum number of nodes (the [maxPerZone](#nodegroup-v1alpha2-spec-cloudinstances-maxperzone) parameter) rounded down, but not less than one.

                        - `RollingUpdate` — in this mode, a **new** node with new settings will be created; then, the old node will be deleted. Available only for cloud nodes.

                        If the `RollingUpdate` mode is not used, when updating, the node is first drained and then updated (rebooted) and put back into operation (uncordoned). Note that in this case, the cluster must have sufficient resources to accommodate the load while the node being updated is unavailable. In the `RollingUpdate` mode, the node is **replaced** by the updated node, i.e., an extra node appears in the cluster for the duration of the update. In cloud infrastructures, the `RollingUpdate` mode is convenient, for example, if there are no resources in the cluster to temporarily host the load from the node being updated.

                        - `Manual` — disable automatic disruption approval; the alert will be displayed if disruption is needed. **Caution!** The `master` node group update mode must be `Manual` to avoid issues with draining.
                        - `Automatic` —  automatically approve disruption-involving updates.
                        - `RollingUpdate` — in this mode, a **new** node with new settings will be created; then, the old node will be deleted. Available only for cloud nodes.

                        If the `RollingUpdate` mode is not used, when updating, the node is first drained and then updated (rebooted) and put back into operation (uncordoned). Note that in this case, the cluster must have sufficient resources to accommodate the load while the node being updated is unavailable. In the `RollingUpdate` mode, the node is **replaced** by the updated node, i.e., an extra node appears in the cluster for the duration of the update. In cloud infrastructures, the `RollingUpdate` mode is convenient, for example, if there are no resources in the cluster to temporarily host the load from the node being updated.
