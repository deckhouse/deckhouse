{!{/*
Multifile generator of e2e workflows.

One workflow file for each provider.

Workflow consists of jobs for each possible pair of CRI and Kubernetes version.
Jobs are enabled according to outputs from check labels job.

A note on werf.yaml and deckhouse image tag:

$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME environment variable is used in werf.yaml, so it is needed
    for successful run of werf commands.

$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG is a tag of published deckhouse images. It has a form
    of "pr<PR_NUMBER>" for pull requests and deckouse Deployment uses this tag
    to auto update testing cluster on new commits.
    The Git tag is slugified in case it constains a plus sign.
