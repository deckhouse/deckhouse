  features:

      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/9658
      impact: >-
        Please note the following important points for metallb module:

        - Cluster readiness: before migration, you may need to ensure the cluster is in a specific
        state (refer to cluster alerts).

        - Backup configurations: it is highly recommended to backup custom resource configurations
        like L2Advertisement and IPAddressPool which were created manually bypassing the
        ModuleConfig before migration.

        - Additional resources: after migrating the L2 balancer, additional MetalLoadBalancerClass
        resources will be created in the cluster. These resources are used to configure the module
        instead of ModuleConfig.
