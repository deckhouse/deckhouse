    - summary: Automatic update of Kubernetes version from 1.19 to 1.21.
      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1288
      impact: >-
        For clusters with automatic Kubernetes version selection, Kubernetes v1.21 becomes the
        default version.

        * The Kubernetes version update in such clusters will be done during the Deckhouse version
        update.

        * Updating the Kubernetes version will cause the restart of the cluster Control Plane
        components.

        * Run the following command to find out if the cluster has enabled automatic Kubernetes
        version selection: `kubectl -n kube-system get secret d8-cluster-configuration -o json | jq
        '.data."cluster-configuration.yaml"' -r | base64 -d | grep kubernetesVersion`. If the result
        is ‘kubernetesVersion: Automatic’ — the cluster has enabled automatic Kubernetes version
        selection.
