# Changelog v1.32

## Know before update


 - Add alerts with the recommended course of action to monitor LINSTOR, Piraeus-operator, capacity of storage-pools and resources states
 - Added Grafana dashboard to monitor LINSTOR cluster and DRBD resources
 - Etcd will be restarted.
 - For clusters with automatic Kubernetes version selection, Kubernetes v1.21 becomes the default version.
    * The Kubernetes version update in such clusters will be done during the Deckhouse version update.
    * Updating the Kubernetes version will cause the restart of the cluster Control Plane components.
    * Run the following command to find out if the cluster has enabled automatic Kubernetes version selection: `kubectl -n kube-system get secret d8-cluster-configuration -o json | jq '.data."cluster-configuration.yaml"' -r | base64 -d | grep kubernetesVersion`. If the result is ‘kubernetesVersion: Automatic’ — the cluster has enabled automatic Kubernetes version selection.
 - Multimaster clusters will automatically turn LINSTOR into HA-mode
 - Now LVM pools will automatically be added to the LINSTOR cluster and StorageClasses generated
 - OpenVPN will be migrated from using PVC to store certificates to Kubernetes secrets. PVC will still remain in the cluster as a backup. If you don't need it, you should manually delete it from the cluster.
 - The new module - ceph-csi. Manages the creation of Ceph volumes (RBD and CephFS) and attaches them to workloads.
 - The new module - snapshot-controller. Enables snapshot support for compatible CSI drivers in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Fixes


 - **[candi]** Added imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent to kubernetes-api-proxy static pod. Fixed kubernetes-api-proxy run in docker envs. [#1297](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1297)
 - **[cloud-provider-aws]** The necessary IAM policies for creating a peering connection have been added to the documentation. [#504](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/504)
 - **[cloud-provider-vsphere]** Correct behavior of nestedHardwareVirtualization parameter for VsphereInstanceClass. [#1331](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1331)
    Node groups with VsphereInstanceClass runtimeOptions.nestedHardwareVirtualization set to false have to be manually updated for this setting to take place. New nodes will be created with disabled nested hardware virtualization if it is disabled in configuration.
 - **[control-plane-manager]** Add the `--experimental-initial-corrupt-check` flag for etcd. [#1267](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1267)
    Etcd will be restarted.
 - **[linstor]** LINSTOR module now supports high-availability [#1147](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1147)
    Multimaster clusters will automatically turn LINSTOR into HA-mode
 - **[node-local-dns]** Reworked health checking logic [#388](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/388)
    Now Pods shouldn't crash unexpectedly now due to poor implementation of locking/probing.
 - **[openvpn]** Fixed OpenAPI [#1307](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1307)
 - **[openvpn]** Web interface changed to https://github.com/flant/ovpn-admin. Persistent storage has been replaced with Kubernetes secrets. Added HostPort inlet. [#522](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/522)
    OpenVPN will be migrated from using PVC to store certificates to Kubernetes secrets. PVC will still remain in the cluster as a backup. If you don't need it, you should manually delete it from the cluster.
 - **[prometheus]** Set Grafana sample limit to 5000 [#1215](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1215)
 - **[upmeter]** Upmeter no longer exposes DNS queries to the Internet [#1256](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1256)
 - **[upmeter]** Fixed the calculation of groups uptime [#1144](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1144)

## Chore


 - **[cert-manager]** Bump to version 1.7.1. Fix a possible bug with ACME solvers when you don't have a default ingress class like nginx (a very rare case). Minor bug fixes [#1082](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1082)
 - **[upmeter]** Remove redundant smoke-mini Ingress [#1237](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1237)
