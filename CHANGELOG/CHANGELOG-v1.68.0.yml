      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/11049
      impact: >-
        All authenticators deployed in Deckhouse will inherit the `highAvailability` option from the
        corresponding module instead of using this option's value from the `user-authn` module.
        Therefore, for example, if the `prometheus` module runs in the non-HA mode, the
        DexAuthenticator instance will also be deployed without HA.
