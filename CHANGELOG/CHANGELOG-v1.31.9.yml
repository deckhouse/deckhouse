        Add migration to remove "node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers" label from
        control-plane nodes
      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/1218
      impact: >-
        node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers label will be deleted from the
        master node group. It also can not be set manually in the current release.

        Without "node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers" label traffic can be
        directed to control plane nodes.

        In the next release, migration will delete it, and users can add it manually if necessary.
