# Changelog v1.67

## Know before update


 - All modules with distroless image will be restarted.
 - Dashboard module works only via HTTPS and no longer supports the "Basic" HTTP authentication scheme.
 - Please note the following important points for metallb module:
    - Cluster readiness: before migration, you may need to ensure the cluster is in a specific state (refer to cluster alerts).
    - Backup configurations: it is highly recommended to backup custom resource configurations like L2Advertisement and IPAddressPool which were created manually bypassing the ModuleConfig before migration.
    - Additional resources: after migrating the L2 balancer, additional MetalLoadBalancerClass resources will be created in the cluster. These resources are used to configure the module instead of ModuleConfig.
 - The `releaseChannel`, `bundle` and `logLevel` parameters of the InitConfiguration resource are no longer available. Use the corresponding parameters in the ModuleConfig `deckhouse` instead.
 - v1alpha1 API version for ModulePullOverride is deprecated. A module source is now selected according to the moduleConfig.
 - v1alpha1 API version for ModuleUpdatePolicy is deprecated, the  source for the module and the module update policy is now selected according to the moduleConfig.
