    - summary: Rename 'group' field to 'groups' in WebhookResourceSpec
      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/17902
    - summary: Fixed SecurityPolicyException usage, added CR presence check.
      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/17660
    - summary: Allowed node-local `user-authz-webhook` listener port (40443/TCP) for hostNetwork pods.
      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/17656
      impact: >-
        The `user-authz-webhook` DaemonSet now explicitly declares its listener port and has a
        matching

        SecurityPolicyException. This prevents Admission Policy Engine validation failures
        in-cluster.

        A targeted `dmt lint` exception is added for the `host-network-ports` rule because it
        enforces

        the 4200–4299 range and does not take SecurityPolicyException into account.
    - summary: >-
        Made user-authz webhook use node-local kube-apiserver endpoint to avoid ClusterIP
        connectivity issues.
      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/17580
      impact: >-
        Improves stability of the user-authz authorization webhook in environments where hostNetwork
        pods cannot reach ClusterIP services.

        Prevents intermittent Kubernetes API errors when kube-apiserver authorization is configured
        in fail-closed mode.
    - summary: Add securityPolicyException for webhook daemonset

    - summary: >-
        InPlaceOrRecreate allows in-place resize when replica group is below minReplicas; eviction
        fallback is blocked in that case.
      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/17725
      impact: >-
        Single-replica (or small) workloads with VPA InPlaceOrRecreate can now receive resource
        updates via in-place resize.

        Eviction/recreate is still forbidden when live replicas are below minReplicas, so
        availability is not reduced.
    - summary: Updated vpa module to 1.5.1.
      pull_request: https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/pull/16814
      impact: >-
        Mode `Auto` is deprecated and will be removed in a future API version. Use explicit modes
        like `Recreate`, `Initial`, or `InPlaceOrRecreate` instead.
  fixes:
    - summary: Fixed VPA mode validation webhook. Restored some wrong changes.
