        Add OpenAPI spec for global values. Validates configuration  section of a
         ConfigMap.
      note: >-
        If Deckhouse upgrading on a new version was failed with the OpenAPI validation error, please
        report us. Do not change/remove params from d8-system/deckhouse ConfigMap, and please wait
        for an OpenAPI specification fix. And you have to restart Deckhouse manually to apply
        updates because auto-updating begins work after global values validation.
