## Before you begin

If you want to install Deckhouse into a **new** cluster, we recommend going back to the previous step and following the "Deploying a cluster with Deckhouse" guide.

Kubernetes clusters have their own particularities and differences depending on the specific cloud provider, just like clusters deployed manually. The best strategy for installing Deckhouse in such clusters is to install the minimal Deckhouse configuration first, and then enable the necessary modules.

This guide covers installing Deckhouse in a **minimal** configuration, with the [internal documentation module](../../documentation/v1/modules/810-deckhouse-web/) (for a sample web application) and [cert-manager](../../documentation/v1/modules/101-cert-manager/) module enabled.

After completing all the steps in this guide, you will have to enable all the required modules manually. Please, refer to the [documentation](/documentation/) to learn more or reach out to the Deckhouse [community](https://deckhouse.io/en/community/about.html).

## Installation process

You will need:
1. **Personal computer**.

   The computer from which the installation will be performed.{% unless page.platform_type == "existing" %} It is only needed to run the Deckhouse installer, and will not be part of the cluster.{% endunless %}

   Requirements:
   - HTTPS-access to the container registry `registry.deckhouse.io` (it is also possible to use a [third-party registry](/en/documentation/v1/deckhouse-faq.html#how-do-i-configure-deckhouse-to-use-a-third-party-registry));
{%- if page.platform_type == "existing" %}
   - The kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
{%- else %}
   - SSH key access to the node, the **master node** of the future cluster.
{%- endif %}
{% if page.platform_type == "existing" %}
1. **The existing Kubernetes cluster**.

   You will need a running Kubernetes cluster with the [supported Kubernetes version and OS](../../documentation/v1/supported_versions.html).

   During the installation, the Deckhouse installer running on the **personal computer** (see step 1) will connect to the cluster and deploy Deckhouse.
{%- else %}
1. **Master-node**.

   A server {% if page.platform_type == 'baremetal' or page.platform_type == 'existing' %}(physical server or virtual machine){% else %}(virtual machine){% endif %}, the master node of the future cluster.
{%- endif %}

{% unless page.platform_type == "existing" %}
    During the installation, the Deckhouse installer running on the **personal computer** (section 1) will connect to that host via SSH, install necessary packages, configure control plane Kubernetes, and deploy Deckhouse. Note that **master node-based** installation is **not supported** at the moment.

   Requirements:
   - at least 4 CPU cores;
   - at least 8 GB of RAM;
   - at least 40 GB of disk space for the cluster and etcd data;
   - OS: Ubuntu Linux 16.04/18.04/20.04 LTS or CentOS 7;
   - HTTPS access to the `registry.deckhouse.io` container registry (it is also possible to use a [third-party registry](/en/documentation/v1/deckhouse-faq.html#how-do-i-configure-deckhouse-to-use-a-third-party-registry));
   - SSH key access from the **personal computer** (section 1).

1. Additional nodes (not required).
{% if page.platform_type == 'cloud' %}
   Depending on the purpose of the cluster and chosen node layout in the following steps, additional nodes will be automatically provisioned from the selected cloud provider.
{%- else %}
   Depending on the purpose of the cluster, you may need additional nodes, for example, dedicated nodes for monitoring, a load balancer, etc.
{%- endif %}

   Below are the minimum requirements for any node (node group) with the monitoring role ([learn more](/en/documentation/v1/#advanced-scheduling)):
   - at least 4 CPU cores;
   - at least 8 GB of RAM;
   - OS: Ubuntu Linux 16.04/18.04/20.04 LTS or CentOS 7;
   - HTTPS access to the `registry.deckhouse.io` container registry (it is also possible to use a [third-party registry](/en/documentation/v1/deckhouse-faq.html#how-do-i-configure-deckhouse-to-use-a-third-party-registry)).
{%- endunless %}

   > By default, the default storage class defined in the cluster is used as storage for system components (or `emptydir`, if it is not defined). You can specify the storage class using the global parameter [storageClass](/en/documentation/v1/deckhouse-configure-global.html#parameters).

The presentation below is an overview of the actions that will be required to install Deckhouse Platform. While it's totally fine to skip it, we recommend that you watch it to better understand the following steps.

Note that it's only a brief, abstract overview. The specific actions and commands to execute will be given on the next steps.
