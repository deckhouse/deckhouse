## Automatic Update

The platform supports automatic updates, allowing the system to stay up-to-date without user intervention. This mode is recommended for most users as it minimizes the risk of system obsolescence and ensures timely access to functional and security improvements.

## Update Windows

To provide flexibility in the update process, you can set update windows. These are specific time intervals during which the system will be updated. This configuration minimizes the impact of updates on workflows and allows them to be aligned with the organization's schedule.

## Manual Update

Manual updating is intended for users who prefer full control over the update process. This approach requires the user to manage all stages, from downloading updates to installing them. Manual updating allows for a thorough review of changes before their application.
