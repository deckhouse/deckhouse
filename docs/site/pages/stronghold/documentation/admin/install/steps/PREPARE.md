Before installing the platform, please complete the following steps to prepare the infrastructure:

- Configure the servers:
  - Install a [supported operating system](../../../about/requirements.html#supported-os).
  - Set up SSH access using key authentication.
- Ensure access to the container registry with Deckhouse images (by default, `registry.deckhouse.io`).
