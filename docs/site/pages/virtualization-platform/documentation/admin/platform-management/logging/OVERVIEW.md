Deckhouse Virtualization Platform (DVP) provides built-in tools for collecting,
delivering, and short-term storage of logs.

DVP logging capabilities:

- Collecting logs from pods and cluster nodes.
- Log processing, including metadata enrichment and message filtering.
- Delivery to various storage and analysis systems, including Loki, Elasticsearch, Splunk, and others.
- Short-term log storage in the cluster with search and visualization capabilities through Grafana.

The following sections describe how to configure log collection and delivery,
as well as organize their short-term storage within the cluster.
