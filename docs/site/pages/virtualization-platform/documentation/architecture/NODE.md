## Node types and addition mechanics

In Deckhouse, nodes are divided into the following types:

- **Static**: Managed manually; `node-manager` does not scale or recreate them.
- **CloudStatic**: Created manually or by any external tools, located in the same cloud that is integrated with one of the cloud provider modules:
  - CloudStatic nodes have several features related to integration with the cloud provider. These nodes are managed by the `cloud-controller-manager` component, resulting in:
    - Zone and region metadata being automatically added to the Node object.
    - When the virtual machine is deleted in the cloud, the corresponding Node object is also removed from the cluster.
    - CSI driver can be used to attach cloud volumes.
- **CloudPermanent**: Persistent nodes created and updated by `node-manager`.
- **CloudEphemeral**: Temporary nodes, created and scaled based on demand.

Nodes are added to the cluster by creating a NodeGroup object, which describes the type, parameters, and configuration of the node group. For CloudEphemeral groups, DVP interprets this object and automatically creates the corresponding nodes, registering them in the Kubernetes cluster. For other types (e.g., CloudPermanent or Static), node creation and registration must be done manually or via external tools.

Hybrid groups are also supported, where a single NodeGroup can include both Static nodes deployed in the cloud and static (bare-metal or virtual machine) nodes. For example, the main load may be handled by bare-metal servers, while cloud instances are used as scalable additions during peak loads.

## Automatic deployment, configuration, and update of Kubernetes nodes

Automatic deployment (in *static/hybrid* â€” partial), configuration, and software updates work in all clusters regardless of being cloud or bare metal.

### Kubernetes node deployment

Deckhouse automatically deploys cluster nodes by performing the following **idempotent** operations:

- OS setup and optimization for working with `containerd` and Kubernetes:
  - Required packages are installed from distribution repositories.
  - Kernel parameters, logging settings, log rotation, and other system parameters are configured.
- Installation of required versions of `containerd` and kubelet, and registration of the node in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Nginx setup and updating the upstream list for balancing requests from the node to the Kubernetes API.

### Maintaining node state

Two types of updates can be applied to maintain the node's up-to-date state:

- **Regular**: Always applied automatically and do not cause downtime or reboot.
- **Disruptive**: Such as kernel or `containerd` updates, significant kubelet version changes, etc. These can be configured in manual or automatic mode via the `disruptions` section. In automatic mode, a node drain is performed before the update.

Only one node per group is updated at a time, and only if all nodes in the group are available.

DVP includes built-in monitoring metrics to track update progress, notify of issues, or prompt for manual approval if needed.

## Working with nodes in supported clouds

Each supported cloud provider allows automatic node provisioning. You need to specify required parameters for each node or group.

Depending on the provider, parameters may include:

- Node type or CPU/memory capacity
- Disk size
- Security settings
- Connected networks, etc.

VM creation, startup, and cluster joining are performed automatically.

### Cloud node scaling

Two node scaling modes are available:

- **Automatic scaling.**

  When resources are insufficient and pods are in `Pending` state, nodes are added to the group. If there is no load on one or several nodes, they are removed from the cluster. With automatic scaling, a group priority is considered (groups with higher priority are scaled first).
  
  To enable auto-scaling, specify different non-zero values for `minPerZone` and `maxPerZone` number of nodes per group.

- **Fixed node count.**

  Deckhouse will maintain the specified number of nodes (for example, by provisioning new nodes to replace failed ones).

  To disable auto-scaling and maintain a fixed count, use the same value for `minPerZone` and `maxPerZone`.

## Working with Static nodes

When working with static nodes, `node-manager` functions are limited as follows:

- **No node provisioning.** Resource allocation (bare-metal servers, VMs, etc.) is manual. Further configuration (joining the cluster, monitoring, etc.) can be fully or partially automated.
- **No auto-scaling.** Maintaining node count in a group is available using Cluster API Provider Static (via the `staticInstances.count` parameter). Deckhouse tries to keep the specified node count in the group, removing excessive nodes and configuring the new ones (from StaticInstance resources in *Pending* state).

Node configuration, draining, adding to the cluster and removal can be performed in one of the following ways:

- **Manually** using prepared scripts.

  To configure a server (VM) and add a node to the cluster, download and run a bootstrap script. It's generated for each static NodeGroup and stored in the secret `d8-cloud-instance-manager/manual-bootstrap-for-<NODEGROUP-NAME>`.

  To remove a node from the cluster and wipe the server (VM), use the `/var/lib/bashible/cleanup_static_node.sh` script (already present on each static node).

- **Automatically** using Cluster API Provider Static.

  CAPS connects to the server (VM) using StaticInstance and SSHCredentials resources, configures and adds the node to the cluster.

  If needed (e.g., if a corresponding StaticInstance resource is removed or the node count is decreased), CAPS connects to the cluster node, drains it, and removes from the cluster.

- **Manually, with transition to automatic management** via CAPS.

  > Available since Deckhouse 1.63.

  To transfer an existing cluster node under CAPS control, prepare StaticInstance and SSHCredentials as for automatic management described above, and annotate the StaticInstance resource with `static.node.deckhouse.io/skip-bootstrap-phase: ""`.

## Node grouping and group management

Grouping and managing nodes as a group means that all group nodes will share metadata from the `NodeGroup` custom resource.

Monitoring features for node groups include:

- Grouped node parameter charts
- Grouped node availability alerts
- Alerts for N unavailable nodes or N% group nodes, etc.

## What is the Instance resource

The Instance resource in Kubernetes represents a definition of an ephemeral virtual machine object, without a specific implementation. It's an abstraction used to manage machines created by tools such as `MachineControllerManager` or Cluster API Provider Static.

The object has no specification. Its status includes:

1. Reference to InstanceClass if available.
1. Reference to the Kubernetes Node object.
1. Current machine status.
1. Info on how to check machine creation logs (available during machine creation).

Creating or deleting a machine will create or delete the corresponding Instance resource.
You cannot manually create an Instance resource, but you can delete it. This will remove the machine from the cluster (implementation-dependent).

## When node reboot is required

Some node configuration changes may require a reboot.

For example, a node reboot is needed after modifying `sysctl` parameters like `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope`.

For full details, see the [NodeGroup custom resource](/products/kubernetes-platform/documentation/v1/modules/node-manager/cr.html#nodegroup) documentation.

If InstanceClass or `instancePrefix` values change in the Deckhouse configuration, no `RollingUpdate` will occur. Instead, new MachineDeployment objects will be created and old ones removed. The number of simultaneously provisioned MachineDeployments is defined by the `cloudInstances.maxSurgePerZone` parameter.

When an update requires a node disruption, a pod eviction process is initiated. If a pod cannot be evicted, the eviction attempt is retried every 20 seconds for up to 5 minutes global timeout. After that, pods that have not been evicted are forcefully removed.
