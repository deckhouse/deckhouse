## Providing public access using services

It is often necessary to enable access to virtual machines from outside the cluster, for example, for remote administration or connecting to services hosted on the virtual machine. For these purposes, Kubernetes provides special services that route traffic from external networks to the internal resources of the cluster. Let's explore a few options.

Before proceeding, label the previously created VM:

```shell
d8 k label vm linux-vm app=nginx
```

Example output:

```console
virtualmachine.virtualization.deckhouse.io/linux-vm labeled
```

### Using NodePort service

The `NodePort` service opens a specific port on all nodes in the cluster and redirects the traffic to a designated internal port of the service.

In this example, we will create a `NodePort` service that will open an external port 31880 on all nodes in the cluster and direct incoming traffic to the internal port 80 of a virtual machine running an Nginx application.

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: linux-vm-nginx-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    # Label by which the service determines which virtual machine to route traffic to.
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 31880
EOF
```

### Using a LoadBalancer service

When using the `LoadBalancer` service type, the cluster creates an external load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across all instances of your virtual machine.

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: linux-vm-nginx-lb
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    # Label by which the service determines which virtual machine to route traffic to.
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
EOF
```

### Using services with active health checks

{% alert level="warning" %}
This feature is in testing phase and will be available in upcoming versions.
{% endalert %}

The `ServiceWithHealthchecks` resource allows you to configure active health checks for a service on specified TCP ports. If the health checks for virtual machines are unsuccessful, those machines will not be included in the traffic balancing.

The following types of health checks are supported:

- `TCP` — A standard check using a TCP connection attempt.
- `HTTP` — Sending an HTTP request and expecting a specific response code.
- `PostgreSQL` — Sending a SQL query and expecting a successful execution.

Example of a service with an HTTP health check:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: network.deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceWithHealthchecks
metadata:
  name: linux-vm-active-http-check
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    # Label by which the service determines which virtual machine to route traffic to.
    app: nginx
  healthcheck:
    probes:
    - mode: HTTP
      http:
        targetPort: 8080
        method: GET
        path: /healthz
EOF
```

Example of a service with a TCP health check:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: network.deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceWithHealthchecks
metadata:
  name:  linux-vm-active-tcp-check
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 25
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 2525
  selector:
    # Label by which the service determines which virtual machine to route traffic to.
    app: nginx
  healthcheck:
    probes:
    - mode: TCP
      http:
        targetPort: 2525
EOF
```

Example of a service with a PostgreSQL health check:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: network.deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceWithHealthchecks
metadata:
  name: postgres-read
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    app: postgres
  healthcheck:
    probes:
    - mode: PostgreSQL
      postgreSQL:
        targetPort: 5432
        dbName: postgres
        authSecretName: cred-secret
        query: "SELECT 1"
EOF
```

Example of a service with a PostgreSQL health check for write operations:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: network.deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceWithHealthchecks
metadata:
  name: postgres-write
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    app: postgres
  healthcheck:
    probes:
    - mode: PostgreSQL
      postgreSQL:
        targetPort: 5432
        dbName: postgres
        authSecretName: cred-secret
        query: "SELECT NOT pg_is_in_recovery()"
EOF
```

Where `authSecretName` refers to the name of the Secret that contains the credentials for accessing PostgreSQL.

Example of creating a Secret:

```shell
d8 k create secret generic cred-secret --from-literal=user=postgres --from-literal=password=example cred-secret
```

## Providing public access to virtual machine services using Ingress

Ingress allows managing incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests and routing them to different servers within your cluster. This is the most suitable method if you want to use domain names and SSL termination for accessing your virtual machines.

To publish a virtual machine service via Ingress, you need to create the following resources:

1. Internal service to bind with`Ingress. Example:

   ```yaml
   d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: linux-vm-nginx
   spec:
     selector:
       # Label by which the service determines which virtual machine to route traffic to.
       app: nginx
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 80
   EOF
   ```

1. Ingress resource for publishing. Example:

   ```yaml
   d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: linux-vm
   spec:
     rules:
       - host: linux-vm.example.com
         http:
           paths:
             - path: /
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: linux-vm-nginx
                   port:
                     number: 80
   EOF
   ```

### How to secure an application published via Ingress

To enable authentication through `Dex` for your application, follow these steps:

1. Create a custom resource [DexAuthenticator](../../../reference/cr/dexauthenticator.html). This will create an instance of [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) connected to `Dex`. After the `DexAuthenticator` custom resource is created, the required objects such as Deployment, Service, Ingress, and Secret will appear in the specified `namespace`.

   Example of a `DexAuthenticator` resource:

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1
    kind: DexAuthenticator
    metadata:
      # Prefix for the Dex authenticator pod names.
      # For example, if the name prefix is `app-name`, the Dex authenticator pods will have names like `app-name-dex-authenticator-7f698684c8-c5cjg`.
      name: app-name
      # Namespace where the Dex authenticator will be deployed.
      namespace: app-ns
    spec:
      # The domain of your application. Requests to this domain will be redirected for authentication through Dex.
      applicationDomain: "app-name.kube.my-domain.com"
      # Whether to send the `Authorization: Bearer` header to the application. Useful with `auth_request` in NGINX.
      sendAuthorizationHeader: false
      # The name of the Secret with the SSL certificate.
      applicationIngressCertificateSecretName: "ingress-tls"
      # The name of the Ingress class to use for the Ingress resource created for the Dex authenticator.
      applicationIngressClassName: "nginx"
      # The duration for which the user's session will be considered active.
      keepUsersLoggedInFor: "720h"
      # List of groups allowed to authenticate.
      allowedGroups:
        - everyone
        - admins
      # List of addresses and networks allowed to authenticate.
      whitelistSourceRanges:
        - 1.1.1.1/32
        - 192.168.0.0/24
   ```

1. Connect the application to `Dex`. To do this, add the following annotations to the application's Ingress resource:

   - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://$host/dex-authenticator/sign_in`
   - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: X-Auth-Request-User,X-Auth-Request-Email`
   - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://<NAME>-dex-authenticator.<NS>.svc.{{ C_DOMAIN }}/dex-authenticator/auth`, where:
     - `NAME` is the value of the `metadata.name` parameter of the DexAuthenticator resource;
     - `NS` is the value of the `metadata.namespace` parameter of the DexAuthenticator resource;
     - `C_DOMAIN` is the cluster domain (the `clusterDomain` parameter) from the ClusterConfiguration resource.

    Example annotations in the application's Ingress resource to connect it to `Dex`:

    ```yaml
   annotations:
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://$host/dex-authenticator/sign_in
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://app-name-dex-authenticator.app-ns.svc.cluster.local/dex-authenticator/auth
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: X-Auth-Request-User,X-Auth-Request-Email
   ```

### Configuring CIDR-based restrictions

DexAuthenticator does not have a built-in system for managing authentication permissions based on the user's IP address. Instead, you can use annotations for Ingress resources:

- If you need to restrict access by IP while still allowing authentication through Dex, add an annotation with the allowed CIDRs, separated by commas:

  ```yaml
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range: 192.168.0.0/32,1.1.1.1
  ```

- If you need users from the specified networks to be exempt from authentication in Dex, while users from other networks must authenticate through Dex, add the following annotation:

  ```yaml
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/satisfy: "any"
  ```
