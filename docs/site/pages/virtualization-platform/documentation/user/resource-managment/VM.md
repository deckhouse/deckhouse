## Introduction

This guide is intended for users of Deckhouse Virtualization Platform (DVP) and describes how to create and modify resources that are available for creation in projects and cluster namespaces.

## Quick start on creating a VM

Example of creating a virtual machine with Ubuntu 22.04.

1. Create a virtual machine image from an external source:

   ```yaml
   d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
   kind: VirtualImage
   metadata:
     name: ubuntu
   spec:
     storage: ContainerRegistry
     dataSource:
       type: HTTP
       http:
         url: https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
   EOF
   ```

   How to create a virtual machine image from an external source in the web interface:

   - Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
   - Go to the "Virtualization" → "Disk Images" section.
   - Click "Create Image".
   - Select "Load data from link (HTTP)" from the list.
   - In the form that opens, enter `ubuntu` in the "Image Name" field.
   - Select `ContainerRegistry` in the "Storage" field.
   - In the "URL" field, paste `https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img`.
   - Click the "Create" button.
   - The image status is displayed at the top left, under the image name.

1. Create a virtual machine disk from the image created in the previous step (Caution: Make sure that the default StorageClass is present on the system before creating it):

   ```yaml
   d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
   kind: VirtualDisk
   metadata:
     name: linux-disk
   spec:
     dataSource:
       type: ObjectRef
       objectRef:
         kind: VirtualImage
         name: ubuntu
   EOF
   ```

   How to create a virtual machine disk from the image created in the previous step in the web interface (this step can be skipped and performed when creating a VM):

   - Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
   - Go to the "Virtualization" section → "VM Disks".
   - Click "Create Disk".
   - In the form that opens, enter `linux-disk` in the "Disk Name" field.
   - In the "Source" field, make sure that the "Project" checkbox is selected.
   - Select `ubuntu` from the drop-down list
   - In the "Size" field, you can change the size to a larger one, for example, `5Gi`.
   - In the "StorageClass Name" field, you can select StorageClass or leave the default selection.
   - Click the "Create" button.
   - The disk status is displayed at the top left, under the disk name.

   > Remember, if your StorageClass has the WaitForFirstConsumer setting, the disk will wait for a VM to be created with that disk.
   > In this case, the disk status will be "CREATING 0%," but the disk will already be selectable when creating a VM, [see the disks section](/products/virtualization-platform/documentation/user/resource-management/disks.html).

1. Creating a virtual machine:

   The example uses the cloud-init script to create a cloud user with the cloud password generated as follows:

   ```bash
   mkpasswd --method=SHA-512 --rounds=4096
   ```

   You can change the user name and password in this section:

   ```yaml
   users:
     - name: cloud
       passwd: $6$rounds=4096$G5VKZ1CVH5Ltj4wo$g.O5RgxYz64ScD5Ach5jeHS.Nm/SRys1JayngA269wjs/LrEJJAZXCIkc1010PZqhuOaQlANDVpIoeabvKK4j1
   ```

   Create a virtual machine from the following specification:

   ```yaml
   d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
   kind: VirtualMachine
   metadata:
     name: linux-vm
   spec:
     virtualMachineClassName: generic
     cpu:
       cores: 1
     memory:
       size: 1Gi
     provisioning:
       type: UserData
       userData: |
         #cloud-config
         ssh_pwauth: True
         users:
           - name: cloud
             passwd: "$6$rounds=4096$saltsalt$fPmUsbjAuA7mnQNTajQM6ClhesyG0.yyQhvahas02ejfMAq1ykBo1RquzS0R6GgdIDlvS.kbUwDablGZKZcTP/"
             shell: /bin/bash
             sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
             lock_passwd: False
     blockDeviceRefs:
       - kind: VirtualDisk
         name: linux-disk
   EOF
   ```

   How to create a virtual machine in the web interface:

   - Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
   - Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
   - Click "Create".
   - In the form that opens, enter `linux-vm` in the "Name" field.
   - In the "Machine Parameters" section, you can leave the settings at their default values.
   - In the "Disks and Images" section, in the "Boot Disks" subsection, click "Add".

   If you have already created a disk:
   - In the form that opens, click "Choose from existing".
   - Select the `linux-disk` disk from the list.

   If you have not created a disk:

   - In the form that opens, click "Create new disk”"
   - In the "Name" field, enter `linux-disk`.
   - In the "Source" field, click the arrow to expand the list and make sure that the "Project" checkbox is selected.
   - Select `ubuntu` from the drop-down list.
   - In the "Size" field, you can change the size to a larger one, for example, `5Gi`.
   - In the "Storage Class" field, you can select StorageClass or leave the default selection.
   - Click the "Create and add" button.

   - Scroll down to the "Additional parameters" section.
   - Enable the "Cloud-init" switch.
   - Enter your data in the field that appears:

   ```yaml
   #cloud-config
   ssh_pwauth: True
   users:
     - name: cloud
       passwd: "$6$rounds=4096$saltsalt$fPmUsbjAuA7mnQNTajQM6ClhesyG0.yyQhvahas02ejfMAq1ykBo1RquzS0R6GgdIDlvS.kbUwDablGZKZcTP/"
       shell: /bin/bash
       sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
       lock_passwd: False
   ```

   - Click the "Create" button.
   - The VM status is displayed at the top left, under its name.

1. Verify with the command that the image and disk have been created and the virtual machine is running. Resources are not created instantly, so you will need to wait a while before they are ready.

   ```bash
   d8 k get vi,vd,vm
   ```

   Example output:

   ```console
   NAME                                                 PHASE   CDROM   PROGRESS   AGE
   virtualimage.virtualization.deckhouse.io/ubuntu      Ready   false   100%
   #
   NAME                                                 PHASE   CAPACITY   AGE
   virtualdisk.virtualization.deckhouse.io/linux-disk   Ready   300Mi      7h40m
   #
   NAME                                                 PHASE     NODE           IPADDRESS     AGE
   virtualmachine.virtualization.deckhouse.io/linux-vm  Running   virtlab-pt-2   10.66.10.2    7h46m
   ```

1. Connect to the virtual machine using the console (press `Ctrl+]` to exit the console):

   ```bash
   d8 v console linux-vm
   ```

   Example output:

   ```console
   Successfully connected to linux-vm console. The escape sequence is ^]
   #
   linux-vm login: cloud
   Password: cloud
   ...
   cloud@linux-vm:~$
   ```

   How to connect to a virtual machine using the console in the web interface:

   - Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
   - Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
   - Select the required VM from the list and click on its name.
   - In the form that opens, go to the "TTY" tab.
   - Go to the console window that opens. Here you can connect to the VM.

1. Use the following commands to delete previously created resources:

   ```bash
   d8 k delete vm linux-vm
   d8 k delete vd linux-disk
   d8 k delete vi ubuntu
   ```

## Virtual machines

The `VirtualMachine` resource is used to create a virtual machine, its parameters allow you to configure:

- [virtual machine class](/products/virtualization-platform/documentation/admin/platform-management/virtualization/virtual-machine-classes.html)
- resources required for virtual machine operation (processor, memory, disks and images);
- rules of virtual machine placement on cluster nodes;
- bootloader settings and optimal parameters for the guest OS;
- virtual machine startup policy and policy for applying changes;
- initial configuration scenarios (cloud-init);
- list of block devices.

The full description of virtual machine configuration parameters can be found at [link](/modules/virtualization/cr.html#virtualmachine)

### Creating a virtual machine

Below is an example of a simple virtual machine configuration running Ubuntu OS 22.04. The example uses the initial virtual machine initialization script (cloud-init), which installs the `qemu-guest-agent` guest agent and the `nginx` service, and creates the `cloud` user with the `cloud` password:

The password in the example was generated using the command `mkpasswd --method=SHA-512 --rounds=4096 -S saltsalt` and you can change it to your own if necessary:

Create a virtual machine with the disk created [previously](/products/virtualization-platform/documentation/user/resource-management/disks.html#creating-a-disk-from-an-image):

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: linux-vm
spec:
  # VM class name.
  virtualMachineClassName: generic
  # Block of scripts for the initial initialization of the VM.
  provisioning:
    type: UserData
    # Example cloud-init script to create cloud user with cloud password and install qemu-guest-agent service and nginx service.
    userData: |
      #cloud-config
      package_update: true
      packages:
        - nginx
        - qemu-guest-agent
      run_cmd:
        - systemctl daemon-reload
        - systemctl enable --now nginx.service
        - systemctl enable --now qemu-guest-agent.service
      ssh_pwauth: True
      users:
        - name: cloud
          passwd: "$6$rounds=4096$saltsalt$fPmUsbjAuA7mnQNTajQM6ClhesyG0.yyQhvahas02ejfMAq1ykBo1RquzS0R6GgdIDlvS.kbUwDablGZKZcTP/"
          shell: /bin/bash
          sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
          lock_passwd: False
      final_message: "The system is finally up, after $UPTIME seconds"
  # VM resource settings.
  cpu:
    # Number of CPU cores.
    cores: 1
    # Request 10% of the CPU time of one physical core.
    coreFraction: 10%
  memory:
    # Amount of RAM.
    size: 1Gi
  # List of disks and images used in the VM.
  blockDeviceRefs:
    # The order of disks and images in this block determines the boot priority.
    - kind: VirtualDisk
      name: linux-vm-root
EOF
```

Check the state of the virtual machine after creation:

```bash
d8 k get vm linux-vm
```

Example output:

```console
NAME        PHASE     NODE           IPADDRESS     AGE
linux-vm   Running   virtlab-pt-2   10.66.10.12   11m
```

After creation, the virtual machine will automatically get an IP address from the range specified in the module settings (`virtualMachineCIDRs` block).

      lock_passwd: False
  final_message: "The system is finally up, after $UPTIME seconds"
  ```

- Click the "Create" button.
- The VM status is displayed at the top left, under its name.

### Virtual Machine Life Cycle

A virtual machine (VM) goes through several phases in its existence, from creation to deletion. These stages are called phases and reflect the current state of the VM. To understand what is happening with the VM, you should check its status (`.status.phase` field), and for more detailed information - `.status.conditions` block. All the main phases of the VM life cycle, their meaning and peculiarities are described below.

![vm-lifecycle](/images/virtualization-platform/vm-lifecycle.png)

- `Pending`: Waiting for resources to be ready

  A VM has just been created, restarted or started after a shutdown and is waiting for the necessary resources (disks, images, ip addresses, etc.) to be ready.
  - Possible problems:
    - Dependent resources are not ready: disks, images, VM classes, secret with initial configuration script, etc.
  - Diagnostics: In `.status.conditions` you should pay attention to `*Ready` conditions. By them you can determine what is blocking the transition to the next phase, for example, waiting for disks to be ready (BlockDevicesReady) or VM class (VirtualMachineClassReady).

    ```bash
    d8 k get vm <vm-name> -o json | jq '.status.conditions[] | select(.type | test(".*Ready"))'
    ```

- `Starting`: Starting the virtual machine

  All dependent VM resources are ready and the system is attempting to start the VM on one of the cluster nodes.
  - Possible problems:
    - There is no suitable node to start.
    - There is not enough CPU or memory on suitable nodes.
    - Namespace or project quotas have been exceeded.
  - Diagnostics:
    - If the startup is delayed, check `.status.conditions`, the `type: Running` condition

      ```bash
      d8 k get vm <vm-name> -o json | jq '.status.conditions[] | select(.type=="Running")'
      ```

- `Running`: The virtual machine is running

  The VM is successfully started and running.
  - Features:
    - When qemu-guest-agent is installed in the guest system, the `AgentReady` condition will be true and `.status.guestOSInfo` will display information about the running guest OS.
      - The `type: FirmwareUpToDate, status: False` condition informs that the VM firmware needs to be updated.
      - Condition `type: ConfigurationApplied, status: False` informs that the VM configuration is not applied to the running VM.
      - The `type: SizingPolicyMatched, status: False` condition informs that the VM resource configuration does not match the sizing policy requirements for the VirtualMachineClass being used and requires that these settings be brought into compliance otherwise new changes to the VM configuration cannot be saved.
      - The `type: AwaitingRestartToApplyConfiguration, status: True` condition displays information about the need to manually reboot the VM because some configuration changes cannot be applied without rebooting the VM.
    - Possible problems:
      - An internal failure in the VM or hypervisor.
    - Diagnosis:
      - Check `.status.conditions`, condition `type: Running`.

        ```bash
        d8 k get vm <vm-name> -o json | jq '.status.conditions[] | select(.type=="Running")'
        ```

- `Stopping`: The VM is stopped or rebooted.

- `Stopped`: The VM is stopped and is not consuming computational resources

- `Terminating`: the VM is deleted.

  This phase is irreversible. All resources associated with the VM are released, but are not automatically deleted.

- `Migrating`: Live migration of a VM.

  The VM is migrated to another node in the cluster (live migration).
  - Features:
    - VM migration is supported only for non-local disks, the `type: Migratable` condition displays information about whether the VM can migrate or not.
  - Possible issues:
    - Incompatibility of processor instructions (when using host or host-passthrough processor types).
    - Difference in kernel versions on hypervisor nodes.
    - Not enough CPU or memory on eligible nodes.
    - Namespace or project quotas have been exceeded.
  - Diagnostics:
    - Check the `.status.conditions` condition `type: Migrating` as well as the `.status.migrationState` block

      ```bash
      d8 k get vm <vm-name> -o json | jq '.status | {condition: .conditions[] | select(.type=="Migrating"), migrationState}'
      ```

The `type: SizingPolicyMatched, status: False` condition indicates that the resource configuration does not comply with the sizing policy of the VirtualMachineClass being used. If the policy is violated, it is impossible to save VM parameters without making the resources conform to the policy.

Conditions display information about the state of the VM, as well as on problems that arise. You can understand what is wrong with the VM by analyzing them:

```bash
d8 k get vm fedora -o json | jq '.status.conditions[] | select(.message != "")'
```

### Configuring CPU and coreFraction

When creating a virtual machine, you can configure how much CPU resources it will use using the `cores` and `coreFraction` parameters.
The `cores` parameter specifies the number of virtual CPU cores allocated to the VM.
The `coreFraction` parameter specifies the guaranteed minimum share of processing power allocated to each core.

{% alert level="warning" %}
Available `coreFraction` values may be defined in the VirtualMachineClass resource for a given range of cores (`cores`), in which case only those values may be used.
{% endalert %}

For example, if you specify `cores: 2`, the VM will be allocated two virtual cores corresponding to the two physical cores of the hypervisor.
If `coreFraction: 20%`, the VM is guaranteed to receive at least 20% of the processing power of each core, regardless of the hypervisor node utilization. At the same time, if there are free resources on the node, the VM can use up to 100% of each core's power to maximize performance.
Thus, the VM is guaranteed to receive 0.2 CPU of the processing power of each physical core and can utilize up to 100% of the power of two cores (2 CPUs) if there are idle resources on the node.

{% alert level="info" %}
If the `coreFraction` parameter is not defined, each VM virtual core is allocated 100% of the physical hypervisor CPU core.
{% endalert %}

Let's look at an example configuration:

```yaml
spec:
  cpu:
    cores: 2
    coreFraction: 10%
```

{% alert level="info" %}
This approach allows for stable VM performance even under high load under conditions of CPU resource oversubscription, where more cores are allocated to virtual machines than are available on the hypervisor.
{% endalert %}

The `cores` and `coreFraction` parameters are taken into account when planning the placement of VMs on nodes. The guaranteed capacity (minimum fraction of each core) is considered when selecting a node so that it can provide the required performance for all VMs. If a node does not have sufficient resources to fulfill the guarantees, the VM will not run on that node.

Visualization on the example of virtual machines with the following CPU configurations, when placed on the same node:

VM1:

```yaml
spec:
  cpu:
    cores: 1
    coreFraction: 20%
```

VM2:

```yaml
spec:
  cpu:
    cores: 1
    coreFraction: 80%
```

![vm-corefraction](/images/virtualization-platform/vm-corefraction.png)

### Virtual machine resource configuration and sizing policy

The sizing policy in VirtualMachineClass, defined in the `.spec.sizingPolicies` section, defines the rules for configuring virtual machine resources, including the number of cores, memory size, and core utilization fraction (`coreFraction`). This policy is not mandatory. If it is not present for a VM, you can specify arbitrary values for resources without strict requirements. However, if a sizing policy is present, the VM configuration must strictly comply with it. Otherwise, it will not be possible to save the configuration.

The policy divides the number of cores (`cores`) into ranges, such as 1-4 cores or 5-8 cores. For each range, it specifies how much memory can be allocated (`memory`) per core and/or what `coreFraction` values are allowed.

If the VM configuration (cores, memory, or coreFraction) does not match the policy, the VM status will show the condition `type: SizingPolicyMatched, status: False`.

If you change the policy in the VirtualMachineClass, you may need to update the configuration of existing VMs to comply with the new policy. Virtual machines that do not meet the requirements of the new policy will continue to run, but any changes to their configuration cannot be saved until they comply with the new conditions.

For example:

```yaml
spec:
  sizingPolicies:
    - cores:
        min: 1
        max: 4
      memory:
        min: 1Gi
        max: 8Gi
      coreFractions: [5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
    - cores:
        min: 5
        max: 8
      memory:
        min: 5Gi
        max: 16Gi
      coreFractions: [20, 50, 100]
```

If the VM uses 2 cores, it falls in the range of 1-4 cores. Then memory can be selected from 1 GB to 8 GB, and coreFraction is only 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, or 100%. For 6 cores, the range is 5-8 cores, where memory is from 5GB to 16GB and coreFraction is 20%, 50% or 100%.

In addition to VM sizing, the policy also allows you to implement the desired maximum oversubscription for VMs.
For example, by specifying `coreFraction: 20%` in the policy, you guarantee any VM at least 20% of the CPU compute resources, which would effectively define a maximum possible oversubscription of 5:1.

### Automatic CPU topology configuration

The CPU topology of a virtual machine (VM) determines how the CPU cores are allocated across sockets. This is important to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with applications that may depend on the CPU configuration. In the VM configuration, you specify only the total number of processor cores, and the topology (the number of sockets and cores in each socket) is automatically calculated based on this value.

The number of processor cores is specified in the VM configuration as follows:

```yaml
spec:
  cpu:
    cores: 1
```

Next, the system automatically determines the topology depending on the specified number of cores. The calculation rules depend on the range of the number of cores and are described below.

- If the number of cores is between 1 and 16 (1 ≤ `.spec.cpu.cores` ≤ 16):
  - 1 socket is used.
  - The number of cores in the socket is equal to the specified value.
  - Change step: 1 (you can increase or decrease the number of cores one at a time).
  - Valid values: any integer from 1 to 16 inclusive.
  - Example: If `.spec.cpu.cores` = 8, topology: 1 socket with 8 cores.
- If the number of cores is from 17 to 32 (16 < `.spec.cpu.cores` ≤ 32):
  - 2 sockets are used.
  - Cores are evenly distributed between sockets (the number of cores in each socket is the same).
  - Change step: 2 (total number of cores must be even).
  - Allowed values: 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32.
  - Limitations: minimum 9 cores per socket, maximum 16 cores per socket.
  - Example: If `.spec.cpu.cores` = 20, topology: 2 sockets with 10 cores each.
- If the number of cores is between 33 and 64 (32 < `.spec.cpu.cores` ≤ 64):
  - 4 sockets are used.
  - Cores are evenly distributed among the sockets.
  - Step change: 4 (the total number of cores must be a multiple of 4).
  - Allowed values: 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64.
  - Limitations: minimum 9 cores per socket, maximum 16 cores per socket.
  - Example: If `.spec.cpu.cores` = 40, topology: 4 sockets with 10 cores each.
- If the number of cores is greater than 64 (`.spec.cpu.cores` > 64):
  - 8 sockets are used.
  - Cores are evenly distributed among the sockets.
  - Step change: 8 (the total number of cores must be a multiple of 8).
  - Valid values: 72, 80, 88, 88, 96, and so on up to 248
  - Limitations: minimum 9 cores per socket.
  - Example: If `.spec.cpu.cores` = 80, topology: 8 sockets with 10 cores each.

The change step indicates by how much the total number of cores can be increased or decreased so that they are evenly distributed across the sockets.

The maximum possible number of cores is 248.

The current VM topology (number of sockets and cores in each socket) is displayed in the VM status in the following format:

```yaml
status:
  resources:
    cpu:
      coreFraction: 10%
      cores: 1
      requestedCores: "1"
      runtimeOverhead: "0"
      topology:
        sockets: 1
        coresPerSocket: 1
```

### Guest OS agent

To improve VM management efficiency, it is recommended to install the QEMU Guest Agent, a tool that enables communication between the hypervisor and the operating system inside the VM.

How will the agent help?

- It will provide consistent snapshots of disks and VMs.
- It will provide information about the running OS, which will be reflected in the status of the VM.
  Example:

  ```yaml
  status:
    guestOSInfo:
      id: fedora
      kernelRelease: 6.11.4-301.fc41.x86_64
      kernelVersion: '#1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Oct 20 15:02:33 UTC 2024'
      machine: x86_64
      name: Fedora Linux
      prettyName: Fedora Linux 41 (Cloud Edition)
      version: 41 (Cloud Edition)
      versionId: "41"
  ```

- Will allow tracking that the OS has actually booted:

  ```bash
  d8 k get vm -o wide
  ```

  Example output (see `AGENT` column):

  ```console
  NAME     PHASE     CORES   COREFRACTION   MEMORY   NEED RESTART   AGENT   MIGRATABLE   NODE           IPADDRESS    AGE
  fedora   Running   6       5%             8000Mi   False          True    True         virtlab-pt-1   10.66.10.1   5d21h
  ```

How to install QEMU Guest Agent:

For Debian-based OS:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-guest-agent
```

For CentOS-based OS:

```bash
sudo yum install qemu-guest-agent
```

Starting the agent service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now qemu-guest-agent
```

### Connecting to a virtual machine

The following methods are available for connecting to the virtual machine:

- remote management protocol (such as SSH), which must be preconfigured on the virtual machine.
- serial console.
- VNC protocol.

An example of connecting to a virtual machine using a serial console:

```bash
d8 v console linux-vm
```

Example output:

```console
Successfully connected to linux-vm console. The escape sequence is ^]
#
linux-vm login: cloud
Password: cloud
```

Press `Ctrl+]` to finalize the serial console.

Example command for connecting via VNC:

```bash
d8 v vnc linux-vm
```

Example command for connecting via SSH.

```bash
d8 v ssh cloud@linux-vm --local-ssh
```

How to connect to a virtual machine in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the required VM from the list and click on its name.
- In the form that opens, go to the "TTY" tab to work with the serial console.
- In the form that opens, go to the "VNC" tab to connect via VNC.
- Go to the window that opens. Here you can connect to the VM.

### Virtual machine startup policy and virtual machine state management

The virtual machine startup policy is intended for automated virtual machine state management. It is defined as the `.spec.runPolicy` parameter in the virtual machine specification. The following policies are supported:

- `AlwaysOnUnlessStoppedManually` (default): After creation, the VM is always in a running state. In case of failures the VM operation is restored automatically. It is possible to stop the VM only by calling the `d8 v stop` command or creating a corresponding operation.
- `AlwaysOn`: After creation the VM is always in a running state, even in case of its shutdown by OS means. In case of failures the VM operation is restored automatically.
- `Manual`: After creation, the state of the VM is controlled manually by the user using commands or operations.
- `AlwaysOff`: After creation the VM is always in the off state. There is no possibility to turn on the VM through commands/operations.

How to select a VM startup policy in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the desired VM from the list and click on its name.
- On the "Configuration" tab, scroll down to the "Additional Settings" section.
- Select the desired policy from the Startup Policy combo box.

The state of the virtual machine can be controlled using the following methods:

Creating a `VirtualMachineOperation` (`vmop`) resource.
Using the `d8` utility with the corresponding subcommand.

The `VirtualMachineOperation` resource declaratively defines an imperative action to be performed on the virtual machine. This action is applied to the virtual machine immediately after it is created by the corresponding `vmop`. The action is applied to the virtual machine once.

Example operation to perform a reboot of a virtual machine named `linux-vm`:

```yaml
d8 k create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineOperation
metadata:
  generateName: restart-linux-vm-
spec:
  virtualMachineName: linux-vm
  type: Restart
EOF
```

You can view the result of the action using the command:

```bash
d8 k get virtualmachineoperation
# or
d8 k get vmop
```

The same action can be performed using the `d8` utility:

```bash
d8 v restart  linux-vm
```

A list of possible operations is given in the table below:

| d8             | vmop type | Action                         |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `d8 v stop`    | `Stop`    | Stop VM                        |
| `d8 v start`   | `Start`   | Start the VM                   |
| `d8 v restart` | `Restart` | Restart the VM                 |
| `d8 v evict`   | `Evict`   | Migrate the VM to another host |

How to perform the operation in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the desired virtual machine from the list and click the ellipsis button.
- In the pop-up menu, you can select possible operations for the VM.

### Change virtual machine configuration

You can change the configuration of a virtual machine at any time after the `VirtualMachine` resource has been created. However, how these changes are applied depends on the current phase of the virtual machine and the nature of the changes made.

Changes to the virtual machine configuration can be made using the following command:

```bash
d8 k edit vm linux-vm
```

If the virtual machine is in a shutdown state (`.status.phase: Stopped`), the changes made will take effect immediately after the virtual machine is started.

If the virtual machine is running (`.status.phase: Running`), the way the changes are applied depends on the type of change:

| Configuration block                     | How changes are applied                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------|
| `.metadata.annotations`                 | Applies immediately                                     |
| `.spec.liveMigrationPolicy`             | Applies immediately                                     |
| `.spec.runPolicy`                       | Applies immediately                                     |
| `.spec.disruptions.restartApprovalMode` | Applies immediately                                     |
| `.spec.affinity`                        | EE, SE+: Applies immediately, CE: Only after VM restart |
| `.spec.nodeSelector`                    | EE, SE+: Applies immediately, CE: Only after VM restart |
| `.spec.*`                               | Only after VM restart                                   |

How to change the VM configuration in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the required VM from the list and click on its name.
- You are now on the "Configuration" tab, where you can make changes.
- The list of changed parameters and a warning if the VM needs to be restarted are displayed at the top of the page.

Let's consider an example of changing the configuration of a virtual machine:

Suppose we want to change the number of processor cores. The virtual machine is currently running and using one core, which can be confirmed by connecting to it through the serial console and executing the `nproc` command.

```bash
d8 v ssh cloud@linux-vm --local-ssh --command "nproc"
```

Example output:

```console
1
```

Apply the following patch to the virtual machine to change the number of cores from 1 to 2.

```bash
d8 k patch vm linux-vm --type merge -p '{"spec":{"cpu":{"cores":2}}}'
```

Example output:

```console
# virtualmachine.virtualization.deckhouse.io/linux-vm patched
```

Configuration changes have been made but not yet applied to the virtual machine. Check this by re-executing:

```bash
d8 v ssh cloud@linux-vm --local-ssh --command "nproc"
```

Example output:

```console
1
```

A restart of the virtual machine is required to apply this change. Run the following command to see the changes waiting to be applied (requiring a restart):

```bash
d8 k get vm linux-vm -o jsonpath="{.status.restartAwaitingChanges}" | jq .
```

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "currentValue": 1,
    "desiredValue": 2,
    "operation": "replace",
    "path": "cpu.cores"
  }
]
```

Run the command:

```bash
d8 k get vm linux-vm -o wide
```

Example output:

```console
NAME        PHASE     CORES   COREFRACTION   MEMORY   NEED RESTART   AGENT   MIGRATABLE   NODE           IPADDRESS     AGE
linux-vm   Running   2       100%           1Gi      True           True    True         virtlab-pt-1   10.66.10.13   5m16s
```

In the `NEED RESTART` column we see the value `True`, which means that a reboot is required to apply the changes.

Let's reboot the virtual machine:

```bash
d8 v restart linux-vm
```

After a reboot, the changes will be applied and the `.status.restartAwaitingChanges` block will be empty.

Execute the command to verify:

```bash
d8 v ssh cloud@linux-vm --local-ssh --command "nproc"
```

Example output:

```console
2
```

The default behavior is to apply changes to the virtual machine through a "manual" restart. If you want to apply the changes immediately and automatically, you need to change the change application policy:

```yaml
spec:
  disruptions:
    restartApprovalMode: Automatic
```

How to perform the operation in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines”"section.
- Select the required VM from the list and click on its name.
- On the "Configuration" tab, scroll down to the "Additional Settings" section.
- Enable the "Auto-apply changes" switch.
- Click on the "Save" button that appears.

### Initialization scripts

Initialization scripts are intended for the initial configuration of a virtual machine when it is started.

The initial initial initialization scripts supported are:

- [CloudInit](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io)
- [Sysprep](https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--system-preparation--overview).

The CloudInit script can be embedded directly into the virtual machine specification, but this script is limited to a maximum length of 2048 bytes:

```yaml
spec:
  provisioning:
    type: UserData
    userData: |
      #cloud-config
      package_update: true
      ...
```

For longer scenarios and/or the presence of private data, the script for initial initial initialization of the virtual machine can be created in Secret. An example of Secret with a CloudInit script is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-init-example
data:
  userData: <base64 data>
type: provisioning.virtualization.deckhouse.io/cloud-init
```

A fragment of the virtual machine configuration using the CloudInit initialization script stored in Secret:

```yaml
spec:
  provisioning:
    type: UserDataRef
    userDataRef:
      kind: Secret
      name: cloud-init-example
```

Note: The value of the `.data.userData` field must be Base64 encoded.

To configure Windows virtual machines using Sysprep, only the Secret variant is supported.

An example of Secret with Sysprep script is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: sysprep-example
data:
  unattend.xml: <base64 data>
type: provisioning.virtualization.deckhouse.io/sysprep
```

Note: The value of the `.data.unattend.xml` field must be Base64 encoded.

Fragment of virtual machine configuration using Sysprep initialization script in Secret:

```yaml
spec:
  provisioning:
    type: SysprepRef
    sysprepRef:
      kind: Secret
      name: sysprep-example
```

### Placement of VMs by nodes

The following methods can be used to manage the placement of virtual machines (placement parameters) across nodes:

- Simple label selection (`nodeSelector`) — the basic method for selecting nodes with specified labels.
- Preferred selection (`Affinity`):
- `nodeAffinity`: Specifies priority nodes for placement.
  - `virtualMachineAndPodAffinity`: Defines workload co-location rules for VMs or containers.
- Co-location avoidance (`AntiAffinity`):
- `virtualMachineAndPodAntiAffinity`: Defines workload rules for VMs or containers to be placed on the same node.

All of the above parameters (including the `.spec.nodeSelector` parameter from VirtualMachineClass) are applied together when scheduling VMs. If at least one condition cannot be met, the VM will not be started. To minimize risks, we recommend:

- Creating consistent placement rules.
- Checking the compatibility of rules before applying them.
- Consider the types of conditions:
- Strict (`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) — require strict compliance.
- Soft (`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) — allow partial compliance.
- Use combinations of labels instead of single restrictions. For example, instead of required for a single label (e.g. env=prod), use several preferred conditions.
- Consider the order in which interdependent VMs are launched. When using Affinity between VMs (for example, the backend depends on the database), launch the VMs referenced by the rules first to avoid lockouts.
- Plan backup nodes for critical workloads. For VMs with strict requirements (e.g., AntiAffinity), provide backup nodes to avoid downtime in case of failure or maintenance.
- Consider existing `taints` on nodes.

{% alert level="info" %}
When changing placement parameters:

- If the current location of the VM meets the new requirements, it remains on the current node.
- If the requirements are violated:

  - In commercial editions: The VM is automatically moved to a suitable node using live migration.
  - In the CE edition: The VM will require a reboot to apply.
    {% endalert %}

How to manage VM placement parameters by nodes in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the required VM from the list and click on its name.
- On the "Configuration" tab, scroll down to the "Placement" section.

#### Simple label binding (nodeSelector)

A `nodeSelector` is the simplest way to control the placement of virtual machines using a set of labels. It allows you to specify on which nodes virtual machines can run by selecting nodes with the desired labels.

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
```

![nodeSelector](/images/virtualization-platform/placement-nodeselector.png)

In this example, there are three nodes in the cluster: two with fast disks (`disktype=ssd`) and one with slow disks (`disktype=hdd`). The virtual machine will only be placed on nodes that have the `disktype` label with the value `ssd`.

How to perform the operation in the web interface in the [Placement section](#placement-of-vms-by-nodes):

- Click "Add" in the "Run on nodes" -> "Select nodes by labels" block.
- In the pop-up window, you can set the "Key" and "Value" of the key that corresponds to the `spec.nodeSelector` settings.
- To confirm the key parameters, click the "Enter" button.
- Click the "Save" button that appears.

#### Preferred Binding (Affinity)

Placement requirements can be:

- Strict (`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) — The VM is placed only on nodes that meet the condition.
- Soft (`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) — The VM is placed on suitable nodes, if possible.

`nodeAffinity`: Determines on which nodes a VM can be launched using tag expressions.

Example of using `nodeAffinity` with a strict rule:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: disktype
                operator: In
                values:
                  - ssd
```

![Node Affinity](/images/virtualization-platform/placement-node-affinity.png)

In this example, there are three nodes in the cluster, two with fast disks (`disktype=ssd`) and one with slow disks (`disktype=hdd`). The virtual machine will only be deployed on nodes that have the `disktype` label with the value `ssd`.

If you use a soft requirement (`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`), then if there are no resources to start the VM on nodes with disks labeled `disktype=ssd`, it will be scheduled on a node with disks labeled `disktype=hdd`.

`virtualMachineAndPodAffinity` controls the placement of virtual machines relative to other virtual machines. It allows you to specify a preference for placing virtual machines on the same nodes where certain virtual machines are already running.

Example of a soft rule:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    virtualMachineAndPodAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 1
          podAffinityTerm:
            labelSelector:
              matchLabels:
                server: database
            topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```

![VM Affinity](/images/virtualization-platform/placement-vm-affinity.png)

In this example, the virtual machine will be placed, if possible (since preferred is used) only on hosts that have a virtual machine with the server label and database value.

How to set "preferences" and "mandatories" for placing virtual machines in the web interface in the [Placement section](#placement-of-vms-by-nodes):

- Click "Add" in the "Run VM near other VMs" block.
- In the pop-up window, you can set the "Key" and "Value" of the key that corresponds to the `spec.affinity.virtualMachineAndPodAffinity` settings.
- To confirm the key parameters, click the "Enter" button.
- Select one of the options "On one server" or "In one zone" that corresponds to the `topologyKey` parameter.
- Click the "Save" button that appears.

#### Avoid co-location (AntiAffinity)

`AntiAffinity` is the opposite of `Affinity`, which allows you to specify requirements to avoid co-location of virtual machines on the same hosts. This is useful for load balancing or fault tolerance.

Placement requirements can be strict or soft:
- Strict (`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) — The VM is scheduled only on nodes that meet the condition.
- Soft (`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) — The VM is scheduled on suitable nodes if possible.

{% alert level="warning" %}
Be careful when using strict requirements in small clusters with few nodes for VMs. If you apply `virtualMachineAndPodAntiAffinity` with `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`, each VM replica must run on a separate node. In a cluster with limited nodes, this may cause some VMs to fail to start due to insufficient available nodes.
{% endalert %}

The terms `Affinity` and `AntiAffinity` apply only to the relationship between virtual machines. For nodes, the bindings used are called `nodeAffinity`. There is no separate antithesis in `nodeAffinity` as with `virtualMachineAndPodAffinity`, but you can create opposite conditions by specifying negative operators in label expressions: to emphasize the exclusion of certain nodes, you can use `nodeAffinity` with an operator such as `NotIn`.

Example of using `virtualMachineAndPodAntiAffinity`:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    virtualMachineAndPodAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              server: database
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```

![VM AntiAffinity](/images/virtualization-platform/placement-vm-antiaffinity.png)

In this example, the virtual machine being created will not be placed on the same host as the virtual machine labeled server: database.

How to configure VM AntiAffinity on nodes in the web interface in the [Placement section](#placement-of-vms-by-nodes):

- Click "Add" in the "Identify similar VMs by labels" -> "Select labels" block.
- In the pop-up window, you can set the "Key" and "Value" of the key that corresponds to the `spec.affinity.virtualMachineAndPodAntiAffinity` settings.
- To confirm the key parameters, click the "Enter" button.
- Check the boxes next to the labels you want to use in the placement settings.
- Select one of the options in the "Select options" section.
- Click the "Save" button that appears.

### Attaching block devices (disks and images)

Block devices can be divided into two types based on how they are connected: static and dynamic (hotplug).

Block devices and their features are shown in the table below:

| Block device type     | Comment                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VirtualImage`        | connected in read-only mode, or as a cdrom for iso images |
| `ClusterVirtualImage` | connected in read-only mode, or as a cdrom for iso images |
| `VirtualDisk`         | connects in read/write mode                               |

#### Static block devices

Static block devices are defined in the virtual machine specification in the `.spec.blockDeviceRefs` block as a list. The order of the devices in this list determines the sequence in which they are loaded. Thus, if a disk or image is specified first, the loader will first try to boot from it. If it fails, the system will go to the next device in the list and try to boot from it. And so on until the first boot loader is detected.

Changing the composition and order of devices in the `.spec.blockDeviceRefs` block is possible only with a reboot of the virtual machine.

VirtualMachine configuration fragment with statically connected disk and project image:

```yaml
spec:
  blockDeviceRefs:
    - kind: VirtualDisk
      name: <virtual-disk-name>
    - kind: VirtualImage
      name: <virtual-image-name>
```

How to work with static block devices in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the required VM from the list and click on its name.
- On the "Configuration" tab, scroll down to the "Disks and Images" section.
- You can add, extract, delete, resize, and reorder static block devices in the "Boot Disks" section.

#### Dynamic Block Devices

Dynamic block devices can be connected and disconnected from a virtual machine that is in a running state without having to reboot it.

The `VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachment` (`vmbda`) resource is used to connect dynamic block devices.

As an example, create the following share that connects an empty blank-disk disk to a linux-vm virtual machine:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachment
metadata:
  name: attach-blank-disk
spec:
  blockDeviceRef:
    kind: VirtualDisk
    name: blank-disk
  virtualMachineName: linux-vm
EOF
```

After creation, `VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachment` can be in the following states (phases):

- `Pending`: Waiting for all dependent resources to be ready.
- `InProgress`: The process of device connection is in progress.
- `Attached`: The device is connected.

Diagnosing problems with a resource is done by analyzing the information in the `.status.conditions` block

Check the state of your resource::

```bash
d8 k get vmbda attach-blank-disk
```

Example output:

```console
NAME              PHASE      VIRTUAL MACHINE NAME   AGE
attach-blank-disk   Attached   linux-vm              3m7s
```

Connect to the virtual machine and make sure the disk is connected:

```bash
d8 v ssh cloud@linux-vm --local-ssh --command "lsblk"
```

Example output:

```console
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda       8:0    0   10G  0 disk <--- statically mounted linux-vm-root disk
|-sda1    8:1    0  9.9G  0 part /
|-sda14   8:14   0    4M  0 part
`-sda15   8:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
sdb       8:16   0    1M  0 disk <--- cloudinit
sdc       8:32   0 95.9M  0 disk <--- dynamically mounted disk blank-disk
```

To detach the disk from the virtual machine, delete the previously created resource:

```bash
d8 k delete vmbda attach-blank-disk
```

Attaching images is done by analogy. To do this, specify `VirtualImage` or `ClusterVirtualImage` and the image name as `kind`:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachment
metadata:
  name: attach-ubuntu-iso
spec:
  blockDeviceRef:
    kind: VirtualImage # or ClusterVirtualImage
    name: ubuntu-iso
  virtualMachineName: linux-vm
EOF
```

How to work with dynamic block devices in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the required VM from the list and click on its name.
- On the "Configuration" tab, scroll down to the "Disks and Images" section.
- You can add, extract, delete, and resize dynamic block devices in the "Additional Disks" section.

### Organizing interaction with virtual machines

Virtual machines can be accessed directly via their fixed IP addresses. However, this approach has limitations: direct use of IP addresses requires manual management, complicates scaling, and makes the infrastructure less flexible. An alternative is services—a mechanism that abstracts access to VMs by providing logical entry points instead of binding to physical addresses.

Services simplify interaction with both individual VMs and groups of similar VMs. For example, the ClusterIP service type creates a fixed internal address that can be used to access both a single VM and a group of VMs, regardless of their actual IP addresses. This allows other system components to interact with resources through a stable name or IP, automatically directing traffic to the right machines.

Services also serve as a load balancing tool: they distribute requests evenly among all connected machines, ensuring fault tolerance and ease of expansion without the need to reconfigure clients.

For scenarios where direct access to specific VMs within the cluster is important (for example, for diagnostics or cluster configuration), headless services can be used. Headless services do not assign a common IP, but instead link the DNS name to the real addresses of all connected machines. A request to such a name returns a list of IPs, allowing you to select the desired VM manually while maintaining the convenience of predictable DNS records.

For external access, services are supplemented with mechanisms such as NodePort, which opens a port on a cluster node, LoadBalancer, which automatically creates a cloud load balancer, or Ingress, which manages HTTP/HTTPS traffic routing.

All these approaches are united by their ability to hide the complexity of the infrastructure behind simple interfaces: clients work with a specific address, and the system itself decides how to route the request to the desired VM, even if its number or status changes.

The service name is formed as `<service-name>.<namespace or project name>.svc.<clustername>`, or more briefly: `<service-name>.<namespace or project name>.svc`. For example, if your service name is `http` and the namespace is `default`, the full DNS name will be `http.default.svc.cluster.local`.

The VM's membership in the service is determined by a set of labels. To set labels on a VM in the context of infrastructure management, use the following command:

```bash
d8 k label vm <vm-name> label-name=label-value
```

Example:

```bash
d8 k label vm linux-vm app=nginx
```

Example output:

```console
virtualmachine.virtualization.deckhouse.io/linux-vm labeled
```

How to add labels and annotations to VMs in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the desired VM from the list and click on its name.
- Go to the "Meta" tab.
- You can add labels in the "Labels" section.
- You can add annotations in the "Annotations" section.
- Click "Add" in the desired section.
- In the pop-up window, you can set the "Key" and "Value" of the key.
- To confirm the key parameters, click the "Enter" button.
- Click the "Save" button that appears.

#### Headless service

A headless service allows you to easily route requests within a cluster without the need for load balancing. Instead, it simply returns all IP addresses of virtual machines connected to this service.

Even if you use a headless service for only one virtual machine, it is still useful. By using a DNS name, you can access the machine without depending on its current IP address. This simplifies management and configuration because other applications within the cluster can use this DNS name to connect instead of using a specific IP address, which may change.

Example of creating a headless service:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: http
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    # Label by which the service determines which virtual machine to direct traffic to.
    app: nginx
EOF
```

After creation, the VM or VM group can be accessed by name: `http.default.svc`

#### ClusterIP service

ClusterIP is a standard service type that provides an internal IP address for accessing the service within the cluster. This IP address is used to route traffic between different components of the system. ClusterIP allows virtual machines to interact with each other through a predictable and stable IP address, which simplifies internal communication within the cluster.

Example ClusterIP configuration:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: http
spec:
  selector:
    # Label by which the service determines which virtual machine to route traffic to.
    app: nginx
EOF
```

How to perform the operation in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Network" → "Services" section.
- In the window that opens, configure the service settings.
- Click on the "Create" button.

#### Publish virtual machine services using a service with the NodePort type

`NodePort` is an extension of the `ClusterIP` service that provides access to the service through a specified port on all nodes in the cluster. This makes the service accessible from outside the cluster through a combination of the node's IP address and port.

NodePort is suitable for scenarios where direct access to the service from outside the cluster is required without using a external load balancer.

Create the following service:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: linux-vm-nginx-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    # label by which the service determines which virtual machine to direct traffic to
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 31880
EOF
```

![NodePort](/images/virtualization-platform/lb-nodeport.png)

In this example, a service with the type `NodePort` will be created that opens external port 31880 on all nodes in your cluster. This port will forward incoming traffic to internal port 80 on the virtual machine where the Nginx application is running.

If you do not explicitly specify the `nodePort` value, an arbitrary port will be assigned to the service, which can be viewed in the service status immediately after its creation.

#### Publishing virtual machine services using a service with the LoadBalancer service type

`LoadBalancer` is a type of service that automatically creates an external load balancer with a static IP address. This balancer distributes incoming traffic among virtual machines, ensuring the service's availability from the Internet.

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: linux-vm-nginx-lb
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    # label by which the service determines which virtual machine to direct traffic to
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
EOF
```

![LoadBalancer](/images/virtualization-platform/lb-loadbalancer.png)

#### Publish virtual machine services using Ingress

`Ingress` allows you to manage incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests and route them to different servers within your cluster. This is the most appropriate method if you want to use domain names and SSL termination to access your virtual machines.

To publish a virtual machine service through `Ingress`, you must create the following resources:

An internal service to bind to `Ingress`. Example:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: linux-vm-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    # label by which the service determines which virtual machine to direct traffic to
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
EOF
```

And an `Ingress` resource for publishing. Example:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: linux-vm
spec:
  rules:
    - host: linux-vm.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: linux-vm-nginx
                port:
                  number: 80
EOF
```

![Ingress](/images/virtualization-platform/lb-ingress.png)

How to publish a VM service using Ingress in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Network" → "Ingresses" section.
- Click the "Create Ingress" button.
- In the window that opens, configure the service settings.
- Click the "Create" button.

### Live virtual machine migration

Live virtual machine (VM) migration is the process of moving a running VM from one physical host to another without shutting it down. This feature plays a key role in the management of virtualized infrastructure, ensuring application continuity during maintenance, load balancing, or upgrades.

#### How live migration works

The live migration process involves several steps:

1. **Creation of a new VM instance**

   A new VM is created on the target host in a suspended state. Its configuration (CPU, disks, network) is copied from the source node.

1. **Primary Memory Transfer**

   The entire RAM of the VM is copied to the target node over the network. This is called primary transfer.

1. **Change Tracking (Dirty Pages)**

   While memory is being transferred, the VM continues to run on the source node and may change some memory pages. These pages are called dirty pages and the hypervisor marks them.

1. **Iterative synchronization**.

   After the initial transfer, only the modified pages are resent. This process is repeated in several cycles:

   - The higher the load on the VM, the more "dirty" pages appear, and the longer the migration takes.
   - With good network bandwidth, the amount of unsynchronized data gradually decreases.

1. **Final synchronization and switching**.

   When the number of dirty pages becomes minimal, the VM on the source node is suspended (typically for 100 milliseconds):

   - The remaining memory changes are transferred to the target node.
   - The state of the CPU, devices, and open connections are synchronized.
   - The VM is started on the new node and the source copy is deleted.

![Migration](/images/virtualization-platform/migration.png)

{% alert level="warning" %}
Network speed plays an important role. If bandwidth is low, there are more iterations and VM downtime can increase. In the worst case, the migration may not complete at all.
{% endalert %}

#### AutoConverge mechanism

If the network struggles to handle data transfer and the number of "dirty" pages keeps growing, the AutoConverge mechanism can be useful. It helps complete migration even with low network bandwidth.

The working principles of AutoConverge mechanism:

1. **VM CPU slowdown**.

   The hypervisor gradually reduces the CPU frequency of the source VM. This reduces the rate at which new "dirty" pages appear. The higher the load on the VM, the greater the slowdown.

1. **Synchronization acceleration**.

   Once the data transfer rate exceeds the memory change rate, final synchronization is started and the VM switches to the new node.

1. **Automatic Termination**

   Final synchronization is started when the data transfer rate exceeds the memory change rate.

AutoConverge is a kind of "insurance" that ensures that the migration completes even if the network struggles to handle data transfer. However, CPU slowdown can affect the performance of applications running on the VM, so its use should be monitored.

#### Configuring migration policy

To configure migration behavior, use the  `.spec.liveMigrationPolicy` parameter in the VM configuration. The following options are available:

- `AlwaysSafe`: Migration is performed without slowing down the CPU (AutoConverge is not used). Suitable for cases where maximizing VM performance is important but requires high network bandwidth.
- `PreferSafe` (default): Migration runs without AutoConverge, but CPU slowdown can be enabled manually if the migration fails to complete. This is done by using the VirtualMachineOperation resource with `type=Evict` and `force=true`.
- `AlwaysForced`: Migration always uses AutoConverge, meaning the CPU is slowed down when necessary. This ensures that the migration completes even if the network is bad, but may degrade VM performance.
- `PreferForced`: By default migration goes with AutoConverge, but slowdown can be manually disabled via VirtualMachineOperation with the parameter `type=Evict` and `force=false`.

#### Migration types

Migration can be performed manually by the user, or automatically by the following system events:

- Updating the "firmware" of a virtual machine.
- Redistribution of load in the cluster.
- Transferring a node into maintenance mode (Node drain).
- When you change [VM placement settings](#placement-of-vms-by-nodes) (not available in Community edition).

The trigger for live migration is the appearance of the `VirtualMachineOperations` resource with the `Evict` type.

The table shows the `VirtualMachineOperations` resource name prefixes with the `Evict` type that are created for live migrations caused by system events:

| Type of system event | Resource name prefix |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Firmware-update-* | firmware-update-* |
| Load shifting | evacuation-* |
| Drain node | evacuation-* |
| Modify placement parameters | nodeplacement-update-* |

This resource can be in the following states:

- `Pending`: The operation is pending.
- `InProgress`: Live migration is in progress.
- `Completed`: Live migration of the virtual machine has been completed successfully.
- `Failed`: Live migration of the virtual machine has failed.

Diagnosing problems with a resource is done by analyzing the information in the `.status.conditions` block.

You can view active operations using the command:

```bash
d8 k get vmop
```

Example output:

```console
NAME                    PHASE       TYPE    VIRTUALMACHINE      AGE
firmware-update-fnbk2   Completed   Evict   static-vm-node-00   148m
```

You can interrupt any live migration while it is in the `Pending`, `InProgress` phase by deleting the corresponding `VirtualMachineOperations` resource.

How to view active operations in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the required VM from the list and click on its name.
- Go to the "Events" tab.

#### How to perform a live migration of a virtual machine using `VirtualMachineOperations`

Let's look at an example. Before starting the migration, view the current status of the virtual machine:

```bash
d8 k get vm
```

Example output:

```console
NAME                                   PHASE     NODE           IPADDRESS     AGE
linux-vm                              Running   virtlab-pt-1   10.66.10.14   79m
```

We can see that it is currently running on the `virtlab-pt-1` node.

To migrate a virtual machine from one host to another, taking into account the virtual machine placement requirements, the command is used:

```bash
d8 v evict -n <namespace> <vm-name>
```

execution of this command leads to the creation of the `VirtualMachineOperations` resource.

You can also start the migration by creating a `VirtualMachineOperations` (`vmop`) resource with the `Evict` type manually:

```yaml
d8 k create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineOperation
metadata:
  generateName: evict-linux-vm-
spec:
  # virtual machine name
  virtualMachineName: linux-vm
  # operation to evict
  type: Evict
EOF
```

To track the migration of a virtual machine immediately after the `vmop` resource is created, run the command:

```bash
d8 k get vm -w
```

Example output:

```console
NAME                                   PHASE       NODE           IPADDRESS     AGE
linux-vm                              Running     virtlab-pt-1   10.66.10.14   79m
linux-vm                              Migrating   virtlab-pt-1   10.66.10.14   79m
linux-vm                              Migrating   virtlab-pt-1   10.66.10.14   79m
linux-vm                              Running     virtlab-pt-2   10.66.10.14   79m
```

How to perform a live VM migration in the web interface:

- Go to the "Projects" tab and select the desired project.
- Go to the "Virtualization" → "Virtual Machines" section.
- Select the desired virtual machine from the list and click the ellipsis button.
- Select "Migrate" from the pop-up menu.
- Confirm or cancel the migration in the pop-up window.

#### Live migration of virtual machine when changing placement parameters (not available in CE edition)

Let's consider the migration mechanism on the example of a cluster with two node groups (`NodeGroups`): green and blue. Suppose a virtual machine (VM) is initially running on a node in the green group and its configuration contains no placement restrictions.

Step 1: Add the placement parameter
Let's specify in the VM specification the requirement for placement in the green group :

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node.deckhouse.io/group: green
```

After saving the changes, the VM will continue to run on the current node, since the `nodeSelector` condition is already met.

Step 2: Change the placement parameter
Let's change the placement requirement to group blue :

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node.deckhouse.io/group: blue
```

Now the current node (groups green) does not match the new conditions. The system will automatically create a `VirtualMachineOperations` object of type Evict, which will initiate a live migration of the VM to an available node in group blue .

## Network configuration

### IP addresses of virtual machines

The `.spec.settings.virtualMachineCIDRs` block in the `virtualization` module configuration specifies a list of subnets to assign ip addresses to virtual machines (a shared pool of ip addresses). All addresses in these subnets are available for use except the first (network address) and the last (broadcast address).

`VirtualMachineIPAddressLease` (`vmipl`) resource: A cluster resource that manages IP address leases from the shared pool specified in `virtualMachineCIDRs`.

To see a list of IP address leases (`vmipl`), use the command:

```bash
d8 k get vmipl
```

Example output:

```console
NAME             VIRTUALMACHINEIPADDRESS                              STATUS   AGE
ip-10-66-10-14   {"name":"linux-vm-7prpx","namespace":"default"}     Bound    12h
```

`VirtualMachineIPAddress` (`vmip`) resource: A project/namespace resource that is responsible for reserving leased IP addresses and binding them to virtual machines. IP addresses can be allocated automatically or by explicit request.

By default, an ip address is automatically assigned to a virtual machine from the subnets defined in the module and is assigned to it until it is deleted. You can check the assigned ip address using the command:

```bash
d8 k get vmip
```

Example output:

```console
NAME              ADDRESS       STATUS     VM          AGE
linux-vm-7prpx   10.66.10.14   Attached   linux-vm   12h
```

The algorithm for automatically assigning an ip address to a virtual machine is as follows:

- The user creates a virtual machine named `<vmname>`.
- The module controller automatically creates a `vmip` resource named `<vmname>-<hash>` to request an IP address and associate it with the virtual machine.
- To do this, `vmip` creates a `vmipl` lease resource that selects a random IP address from a shared pool.
- Once the `vmip` resource is created, the virtual machine receives the assigned IP address.

The virtual machine's IP address is assigned automatically from the subnets defined in the module and remains assigned to the machine until it is deleted. After the virtual machine is deleted, the `vmip` resource is also deleted, but the IP address remains temporarily assigned to the project/namespace and can be re-requested explicitly.

The full description of `vmip` and `vmipl` machine resource configuration parameters can be found at the links:

- [`VirtualMachineIPAddress`](/modules/virtualization/cr.html#virtualmachineipaddress)
- [`VirtualMachineIPAddressLease`](/modules/virtualization/cr.html#virtualmachineipaddresslease)

#### How to request a required ip address?

Task: request a specific ip address from the `virtualMachineCIDRs` subnets.

Create a `vmip` resource:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineIPAddress
metadata:
  name: linux-vm-custom-ip
spec:
  staticIP: 10.66.20.77
  type: Static
EOF
```

Create a new or modify an existing virtual machine and specify the required `vmip` resource explicitly in the specification:

```yaml
spec:
  virtualMachineIPAddressName: linux-vm-custom-ip
```

#### How to save the ip address assigned to the virtual machine?

Objective: to save the ip address issued to a virtual machine for reuse after the virtual machine is deleted.

To ensure that the automatically assigned ip address of a virtual machine is not deleted along with the virtual machine itself, perform the following steps.

Obtain the `vmip` resource name for the specified virtual machine:

```bash
d8 k get vm linux-vm -o jsonpath="{.status.virtualMachineIPAddressName}"

# linux-vm-7prpx
```

Remove the `.metadata.ownerReferences` blocks from the resource found:

```bash
d8 k patch vmip linux-vm-7prpx --type=merge --patch '{"metadata":{"ownerReferences":null}}'
```

After the virtual machine is deleted, the `vmip` resource is preserved and can be reused again in the newly created virtual machine:

```yaml
spec:
  virtualMachineIPAddressName: linux-vm-7prpx
```

Even if the `vmip` resource is deleted, IP address remains rented for the current project/namespace for another 10 minutes. Therefore, it is possible to reoccupy it on request:

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: virtualization.deckhouse.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineIPAddress
metadata:
  name: linux-vm-custom-ip
spec:
  staticIP: 10.66.20.77
  type: Static
EOF
```

### Additional network interfaces

Virtual machines can be connected not only to the main cluster network interface but also to additional networks provided by the `SDN` module. Such networks include project Networks and ClusterNetworks.

Additional networks are defined in the `.spec.networks` configuration block. If this block is absent (default value), the VM is connected only to the main cluster network.

{% alert level="warning" %}
Changes to the list of additional networks (adding or removing) take effect only after the VM is rebooted.
{% endalert %}

{% alert level="info" %}
To avoid changing the order of network interfaces inside the guest OS, always add new networks to the end of the `.spec.networks` list.
{% endalert %}

Conditions and limitations:

- The `SDN` module is required to work with additional networks.
- The order of networks in `.spec.networks` determines the sequence in which interfaces are attached to the VM bus.
- Configuration of network parameters (IP addresses, gateways, DNS, etc.) in additional networks must be performed manually inside the guest OS (for example, via cloud-init).

Example of connecting a VM to the project network `user-net`:

```yaml
spec:
  networks:
    - type: Main # Must always be specified first
    - type: Network # Network type (Network \ ClusterNetwork)
      name: user-net # Network name
```

Example of connecting to the cluster network `corp-net`:

```yaml
spec:
  networks:
    - type: Main # Must always be specified first
    - type: Network
      name: user-net
    - type: ClusterNetwork
      name: corp-net # Network name
```

You can view information about connected networks and their MAC addresses in the VM status:

```yaml
status:
  networks:
    - type: Main
    - type: Network
      name: user-net
      macAddress: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01
    - type: ClusterNetwork
      name: corp-net
      macAddress: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:02
```

For each additional network interface, a unique MAC address is automatically generated and reserved to avoid collisions. The following resources are used for this: `VirtualMachineMACAddress` (`vmmac`) and `VirtualMachineMACAddressLease` (`vmmacl`).

The MAC address is generated randomly from the allowed ranges:

- Ranges: `x2-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx`, `x6-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx`, `xA-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx`, `xE-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx`.
- The first three octets (OUI) are formed based on the cluster UUID, the last three (NIC) are chosen randomly from 16 million possible combinations.

`VirtualMachineMACAddressLease` (`vmmacl`) is a cluster resource that manages the lease of MAC addresses from the shared MAC address pool.

To see the list of MAC address leases (`vmmacl`), use the command:

```bash
d8 k get vmmacl
```

Example output:

```console
NAME                    VIRTUALMACHINEMACADDRESS                      STATUS   AGE
mac-5e-e6-19-22-0f-d8   {"name":"vm-01-fz9cr","namespace":"pr-sdn"}   Bound    45s
mac-5e-e6-19-29-89-cf   {"name":"vm-01-99qj6","namespace":"pr-sdn"}   Bound    45s
mac-5e-e6-19-54-f9-be   {"name":"vm-01-5jqxg","namespace":"pr-sdn"}   Bound    45s
```

`VirtualMachineMACAddress` (`vmmac`) is a project-level resource that is responsible for reserving leased MAC addresses and binding them to virtual machines.

MAC addresses are automatically assigned to each additional VM interface from the shared address pool and remain assigned until the VM is deleted.

You can check the assigned MAC addresses using the command:

```bash
d8 k get vmmac
```

Example output:

```console
NAME          ADDRESS             STATUS     VM      AGE
vm-01-5jqxg   5e:e6:19:54:f9:be   Attached   vm-01   5m42s
vm-01-99qj6   5e:e6:19:29:89:cf   Attached   vm-01   5m42s
vm-01-fz9cr   5e:e6:19:22:0f:d8   Attached   vm-01   5m42s
```

When a network is removed from the VM configuration:

- The MAC address of the interface is released.
- The associated `VirtualMachineMACAddress` and `VirtualMachineMACAddressLease` resources are automatically deleted.
