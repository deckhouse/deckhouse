<h3>2. Legal bases for processing</h3>
<p>We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and process
    information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.</p>
<p>These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information
    only where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);</li>
    <li>it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
    <li>you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or</li>
    <li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind
    at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).</p>
<p>We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it
    within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying,
    use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and
    cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance
    with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural
    person.</p>
<h3>3. Collection and use of information</h3>
<p>We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes and personal information will not be
    further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p>

<p>We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to
    countries outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection

    means.</p>
<p>Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another country, you acknowledge that third parties
    in other jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There are
    risks if any such third party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in our

    laws.</p>
