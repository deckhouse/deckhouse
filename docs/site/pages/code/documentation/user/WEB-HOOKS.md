Webhooks are an event-driven integration mechanism with external systems. They enable automatic sending of HTTP requests when specific events occur in Deckhouse Code:

- Support for a wide range of events: Push, Merge Request, Issue, Pipeline, Release, and others.
- Request configuration: choice of method (POST, PUT), JSON format, header customization.
- Security features: Secret Token, SSL/TLS, event filtering.
- Support at the project, group, and instance levels.
- Integration with CI/CD, monitoring, messaging platforms, and tracking systems.
- Retry mechanism for connection failures.

> Project webhooks are supported in GitLab CE.

## Group webhooks

To add a webhook at the group level, open the group page and navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Webhooks". Then select the desired events. Group webhooks support all project events plus:

- Member events;
- Project events;
- Subgroup events.

> If the user has no public email specified, the email in the request body will appear as "[REDACTED]".  
> Member events trigger upon creation, modification, or deletion of group or project members.
