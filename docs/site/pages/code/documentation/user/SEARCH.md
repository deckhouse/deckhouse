Search in the system helps quickly find the necessary information within projects, groups, or across the entire instance. It allows searching both through repository content and related objects. You can search by **code snippets**, **comments**, **commits**, **epics**, **issues**, **merge requests**, **milestones**, **projects**, **users**, and **wikis**. Results are ranked by relevance and provide direct navigation to the found objects.
