            </h2>
            <p>
                Deckhouse Platform follows the <strong>upstream version of Kubernetes</strong>, using that as a basis to build all of its features and configurations on.
            </p><p>
                Deckhouse Platform's basic functions are implemented via <strong>two building blocks: shell-operator &amp; addon-operator</strong>. Both have been available as Open Source projects since April/May 2019.
            </p><p>
                Aside from Deckhouse, various vendors (including KubeSphere, Confluent, and Adobe, just to name a few) and DevOps/Kubernetes enthusiasts have adopted these tools to implement instruments of their own.
            </p><p>
                To sum it up in a nutshell, Deckhouse Platform — as a Kubernetes distribution — is an upstream Kubernetes packed with a whole bunch of modules based on addon-operator.
