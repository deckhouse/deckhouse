        CIS Benchmarks
      </h2>
      <p class="text text_big">
        Deckhouse meets <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes" target="_blank">CIS Kubernetes Benchmark recommendations</a>*.
        Security measures are implemented both at the component and platform level. For example, you can restrict network access to only the necessary interfaces, prohibit anonymous access, use certificates, set permissions for files and directories.
        Automatic tests are run in all Deckhouse clusters to ensure compliance with CIS Benchmarks. Reports with the results are then listed in the Grafana dashboard.

          Building components
        </h2>
      </div>
      <ul class="features__item-list">
        <li>
          Docker images for all platform components can only be pulled from the Deckhouse repository.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only the necessary binaries from the original image files created by the software authors are used.
        </li>
        <li>
          All dependencies related to the original images as well as the SHA digest of the image are strictly pre-defined. The resulting image is built based on the base image made specifically for Deckhouse.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the vast majority of cases, we use Alpine (the most secure Linux distribution) to build the base image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deckhouse and Kubernetes components are updated on a regular basis.
        </li>
        <li>
          We carefully select our software. We only use solutions that have been proven to be reliable based on our own experience and that of the Open Source community.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of the checks are performed automatically by linters. Among other things, these checks ensure that the Dockerfile configuration is correct and prohibit the use of third-party images.
        </li>
        <li>
          The CI builds are scanned for CVEs every day; the scan report is sent to the developers. All the Sn level (and more critical) vulnerabilities are addressed within 3 hours, while those of Sn-Sk levels are dealt with within 24 hours.

          Configuring components and their interaction
        </h2>
      </div>
      <ul class="features__item-list">
        <li>
          Each component runs with a minimal set of privileges in Kubernetes that is sufficient for its operation (the ""minimum RBAC"" policy).
        </li>
        <li>
          Components never have root privileges. Exceptions are explicitly defined in the permission list.
        </li>
        <li>
          The root file system is read-only (except for a small number of specific directories).
        </li>
        <li>
          Local ports of all Deckhouse components are secured with TLS encryption and authentication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Linters check that RBAC rights are explicitly and unambiguously defined in a specific file of each Deckhouse module. This ensures a single point of control.
        </li>
        <li>
          The naming scheme for Service Accounts, roles, rolebindings, etc. is enforced, whoch protects against human errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authentication between cluster components is carried out in two ways: via TLS or bearer tokens. Authorization is performed via Kubernetes mechanisms (SubjectAccessReview).
