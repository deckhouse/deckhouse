search: autoscaler, HorizontalPodAutoscaler
---

Below, only HPAs of the [apiVersion: autoscaling/v2](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#objectmetricsource-v2-autoscaling) type (supported from Kubernetes v1.12 onward) are considered.

To configure an HPA, you need to:
* determine the scaling target (`.spec.scaleTargetRef`);
* define the scaling range (`.spec.minReplicas`, `.scale.maxReplicas`);
* define the metrics that will be used for scaling and register them with the Kubernetes API (`.spec.metrics`).

There are three types of metrics in terms of an HPA:
* [classic](#classic-resource-consumption-based-scaling) — these have the "Resource" type (`.spec.metrics[].type`) and are used to scale based on memory and CPU consumption;
* [custom](#custom-metrics-based-scaling) — these have the "Pods" or "Object" type (`.spec.metrics[].type`);
* [external](#using-external-metrics-with-hpa) — these have the "External" type (`.spec.metrics[].type`).

**Caution!** During scale, HPA uses different approaches [by default](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#default-behavior):
* If the metrics [indicate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#algorithm-details) that HPA must scale **up** the target, it happens immediately (`spec.behavior.scaleUp.stabilizationWindowSeconds` = 0). The only limitation — scale speed. During 15 seconds, the Pods can either double their number or if there are less than 4 Pods now, maximum four new Pods will be added.
* If the metrics [indicate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#algorithm-details) that HPA must scale **down** the target, it happens smoothly. During 5 minutes (`spec.behavior.scaleUp.stabilizationWindowSeconds` = 300), HPA collects suggestions about scaling and finally chooses the largest value. There aren't scale-down speed limitations.

If you have metric flapping problems which lead to unwanted scales, there are options:
* If your metric is based on a PromQL query, you can use an aggregation function like `avg_over_time()` to smooth out the fluctuations. [Example...](#example-of-using-unstable-custom-metric)
* You can increase `spec.behavior.scaleUp.stabilizationWindowSeconds` in `HorisontalPodAutoscaler` resource. In this case, HPA collects scale suggestions during the period and finally chooses the minimal value. In other words, this solution is identical using the `min_over_time(<stabilizationWindowSeconds>)` aggregating function only when the metric is growing up, and HPA decides to scale **up**. For scaling **down**, it is usually enough standard Stabilisation Window settings. [Example...](#classic-resource-consumption-based-scaling)
* You can also tighten the scale-up speed with `spec.behavior.scaleUp.policies` settings.

## What scaling type should I prefer?

1. The typical use-cases of a [classic](#classic-resource-consumption-based-scaling) type are pretty obvious.
1. Suppose you have a single application, the source of metrics is located inside the namespace, and it is associated with one of the objects. In this case, we recommend using the [custom](#custom-metrics-based-scaling) namespace-scoped metrics.
1. Use [custom](#custom-metrics-based-scaling) Cluster-wide metrics if multiple applications use the same metric associated with one of the objects, and the metric's source belongs to the application namespace. Such metrics can help you combine common infrastructure components into a separate ("infra") Deployment.
1. Use [external](#using-external-metrics-with-hpa) metrics if the source of the metric does not belong to the application namespace. These can be, for example, cloud provider or SaaS-related metrics.

**Caution!** We strongly recommend using either Option 1. ([classic](#classic-resource-consumption-based-scaling) metrics) or Option 2. ([custom](#custom-metrics-based-scaling) metrics defined in the namespace). In this case, you can define the entire configuration of the application (including the autoscaling logic) in the repository of the application. Options 3 and 4 should only be considered if you have a large collection of identical microservices.

## Classic resource consumption-based scaling

Below is an example of the HPA for scaling based on standard `metrics.k8s.io`metrics (CPU and memory of the Pods). Please, take special note of the `averageUtulization` — this value reflects the target percentage of resources that have been **requested**.

{% raw %}

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: app-hpa
  namespace: app-prod
spec:
  # The targets of scaling (link to a Deployment or StatefulSet).
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: app
  # Min and max values for replication.
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  behavior:
    # If short-term spikes of CPU usage are regular for the application,
    # you can postpone the scaling decision to be sure if it is necessary.
    # By default, scaling up occurs immediately.
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
  metrics:
  # Scaling based on CPU and Memory consumption.
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        # Scale up if the average CPU utilization by all the Pods in scaleTargetRef exceeds the specified value.
        # For type: Resource metrics only the type: Utilization parameter is available.
        type: Utilization
        # Scale up if all the Deployment's Pods have requested 1 CPU core and consumed more than 700m on average.
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        # Scale up if the average Memory utilization by all the Pods in scaleTargetRef exceeds the specified value.
        type: Utilization
        # Scale up if all the Deployment's Pods have requested 1GB and consumed more than 800MB on average.
        averageUtilization: 80
```

{% endraw %}

## Custom metrics-based scaling

### Registering custom metrics with the Kubernetes API

Custom metrics must be registered with the `/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/` API. In our case, `prometheus-metrics-adapter` (it also implements the API) performs the registration. The `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` object can refer to these metrics after the registration is complete. Setting up a vanilla  `prometheus-metrics-adapter` is a time-consuming process. Happily, we have somewhat simplified it by defining a set of [Custom Resources](cr.html) with different Scopes:
* Namespaced:
  * `ServiceMetric`
  * `IngressMetric`
  * `PodMetric`
  * `DeploymentMetric`
  * `StatefulsetMetric`
  * `NamespaceMetric`
  * `DaemonSetMetric` (not available to users)
* Cluster:
  * `ClusterServiceMetric` (not available to users)
  * `ClusterIngressMetric` (not available to users)
  * `ClusterPodMetric` (not available to users)
  * `ClusterDeploymentMetric` (not available to users)
  * `ClusterStatefulsetMetric` (not available to users)
  * `ClusterDaemonSetMetric` (not available to users)

You can globally define a metric using the Cluster-scoped resource, while the namespaced resource allows you to redefine it locally. All CRs have the same [format](cr.html).

### Using custom metrics with HPA

After a custom metric is registered, you can refer to it. For the HPA, custom metrics can be of two types — `Pods` and `Object`. `Object` is a reference to a cluster object that has metrics with the appropriate labels (`namespace=XXX,ingress=YYY`) in Prometheus. These labels will be substituted instead of `<<.LabelMatchers>>` in your custom request.

{% raw %}

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1beta1
kind: IngressMetric
metadata:
  name: mymetric
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  query: sum(rate(ingress_nginx_detail_requests_total{<<.LabelMatchers>>}[2m])) by (<<.GroupBy>>) OR on() vector(0)
---
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
metadata:
  name: myhpa
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  # The targets of scaling (link to a deployment or statefulset).
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myapp
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 2
  # What metrics to use for scaling. We use custom metrics of the Object type.
  metrics:
  - type: Object
    object:
      # Some object that has metrics in Prometheus.
      describedObject:
        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Ingress
        name: myingress
      metric:
        # The metric registered using IngressMetric or ClusterIngressMetric CRs.
        # Can be used rps_1m, rps_5m or rps_15m which come with the prometheus-metrics-adapter module.
        name: mymetric
      target:
        # `Value` or `AverageValue` can be used for metrics of the Object type.
        type: AverageValue
        # Scaling occurs if the average value for all Pods in the Deployment of the custom metric is very different from 10.
        averageValue: 10
```

{% endraw %}

In the case of the `Pods` metric type, the process is more complex. First, metrics with the appropriate labels (`namespace=XXX,pod=YYY-sadiq`,`namespace=XXX,pod=YYY-e3adf`,...) will be collected for all the Pods of the resource to scale. Next, HPA will calculate the average value based on these metrics and will use it for scaling. [Example...](#examples-of-using-custom-metrics-of-the-pods-type)

#### Example of using RabbitMQ queue size-based custom metrics

Suppose there is a `send_forum_message` queue in RabbitMQ, and this message broker is exposed as an `rmq` service. Then, suppose, we want to scale up the cluster if there are more than 42 messages in the queue.

{% raw %}

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceMetric
metadata:
  name: rmq-queue-forum-messages
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  query: sum (rabbitmq_queue_messages{<<.LabelMatchers>>,queue=~"send_forum_message",vhost="/"}) by (<<.GroupBy>>)
---
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
metadata:
  name: myhpa
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  # The targets of scaling (link to a deployment or statefulset).
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myconsumer
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: Object
    object:
      describedObject:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        name: rmq
      metric:
        name: rmq-queue-forum-messages
      target:
        type: Value
        value: 42
```

{% endraw %}

#### Example of using unstable custom metric

Improvement for example above.

Suppose there is a `send_forum_message` queue in RabbitMQ, and this message broker is exposed as an `rmq` service. Then, suppose, we want to scale up the cluster if there are more than 42 messages in the queue. At the same time, we do not want to react to short-term spikes, for this we use MQL-function `avg_over_time()`.

{% raw %}

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceMetric
metadata:
  name: rmq-queue-forum-messages
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  query: sum (avg_over_time(rabbitmq_queue_messages{<<.LabelMatchers>>,queue=~"send_forum_message",vhost="/"}[5m])) by (<<.GroupBy>>)
---
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
metadata:
  name: myhpa
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  # The targets of scaling (link to a deployment or statefulset).
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myconsumer
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: Object
    object:
      describedObject:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        name: rmq
      metric:
        name: rmq-queue-forum-messages
      target:
        type: Value
        value: 42
```

{% endraw %}

#### Examples of using custom metrics of the `Pods` type

Suppose we want the average number of php-fpm workers in the `mybackend` Deployment to be no more than 5.

{% raw %}

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1beta1
kind: PodMetric
metadata:
  name: php-fpm-active-workers
spec:
  query: sum (phpfpm_processes_total{state="active",<<.LabelMatchers>>}) by (<<.GroupBy>>)
---
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
metadata:
  name: myhpa
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  # The targets of scaling (link to a deployment or statefulset).
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: mybackend
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  # HPA must go through all the Pods in the Deployment and collect metrics from them.
  - type: Pods
    # You do not need to specify descripedObject (in contrast to type: Object).
    pods:
      metric:
        # Custom metric, registered using the PodMetric CR.
        name: php-fpm-active-workers
      target:
        # For type: Pods metrics, the AverageValue can only be used.
        type: AverageValue
        # Scale up if the average metric value for all the Pods of the myworker Deployment is greater than 5.
        averageValue: 5
```

{% endraw %}

The Deployment is scaled based on the percentage of active php-fpm workers.

{% raw %}

```yaml
---
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1beta1
kind: PodMetric
metadata:
  name: php-fpm-active-worker
spec:
  # Percentage of active php-fpm workers. The round() function rounds the percentage.
  query: round(sum by(<<.GroupBy>>) (phpfpm_processes_total{state="active",<<.LabelMatchers>>}) / sum by(<<.GroupBy>>) (phpfpm_processes_total{<<.LabelMatchers>>}) * 100)
---
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
metadata:
  name: {{ .Chart.Name }}-hpa
spec:
  # The targets of scaling (link to a deployment or statefulset).
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
  minReplicas: 4
  maxReplicas: 8
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: php-fpm-active-worker
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        # Scale up if, on average, 80% of workers in the deployment are running at full capacity.
        averageValue: 80
```

{% endraw %}

### Registering external metrics with the Kubernetes API

The `prometheus-metrics-adapter` module supports the `externalRules` mechanism. Using it, you can create custom PromQL requests and register them as metrics.

In our installations, we have implemented a universal rule that allows you to create your metrics without using `prometheus-metrics-adapter` — "any Prometheus metric called `kube_adapter_metric_<name>` will be registered in the API under the `<name>`". In other words, all you need is to either write an exporter (to export the metric) or create a [recording rule](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) in Prometheus that will aggregate your metric based on other metrics.

An example of `CustomPrometheusRules`:

{% raw %}

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1
kind: CustomPrometheusRules
metadata:
  # The recommended template for naming your CustomPrometheusRules.
  name: prometheus-metrics-adapter-mymetric
spec:
  groups:
    # Recommended template for the name key.
  - name: prometheus-metrics-adapter.mymetric
    rules:
    # The name of the new metric. Pay attention! The 'kube_adapter_metric_' prefix is required.
    - record: kube_adapter_metric_mymetric
      # The results of this request will be passed to the final metric; there is no reason to include excess labels into it.
      expr: sum(ingress_nginx_detail_sent_bytes_sum) by (namespace,ingress)
```

{% endraw %}

### Using external metrics with HPA

You can refer to a metric after it is registered.

{% raw %}

```yaml
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
metadata:
  name: myhpa
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  # The targets of scaling (link to a deployment or statefulset).
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myapp
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 2
  # Use external metrics for scaling.
  metrics:
  - type: External
    external:
      metric:
        # The metric that we registered by creating a metric in Prometheus's kube_adapter_metric_mymetric but without 'kube_adapter_metric_' prefix.
        name: mymetric
        selector:
          # For external metrics, you can and should specify matching labels.
          matchLabels:
            namespace: mynamespace
            ingress: myingress
      target:
        # Only `type: Value` can be used for metrics of the External type.
        type: Value
        # Scale up if the value of our metric is greater than 10.
        value: 10
```

{% endraw %}

### Example of scaling based on the Amazon SQS queue size

> Note that an exporter is required to integrate with SQS. For this, create a separate "service" git repository (or you can use an "infrastructure" repository) and put the installation of this exporter as well as the script to create the necessary `CustomPrometheusRules` into this repository. If you need to configure autoscaling for a single application (especially if it runs in a single namespace), we recommend putting the exporter together with the application and using `NamespaceMetrics`.

Suppose there is a `send_forum_message` queue in Amazon SQS. Then, suppose, we want to scale up the cluster if there are more than 42 messages in the queue. Also, you will need an exporter to collect Amazon SQS metrics (say, [sqs-exporter](https://github.com/ashiddo11/sqs-exporter)).

{% raw %}

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1
kind: CustomPrometheusRules
metadata:
  # The recommended name — prometheus-metrics-adapter-<metric name>.
  name: prometheus-metrics-adapter-sqs-messages-visible
  # Pay attention!
  namespace: d8-monitoring
  labels:
    # Pay attention!
    prometheus: main
    # Pay attention!
    component: rules
spec:
  groups:
  - name: prometheus-metrics-adapter.sqs_messages_visible # the recommended template
    rules:
    - record: kube_adapter_metric_sqs_messages_visible # Pay attention! The 'kube_adapter_metric_' prefix is required.
      expr: sum (sqs_messages_visible) by (queue)
---
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
metadata:
  name: myhpa
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  # The targets of scaling (link to a deployment or statefulset).
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myconsumer
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: External
    external:
      metric:
        # Must match CustomPrometheusRules record name without 'kube_adapter_metric_' prefix.
        name: sqs_messages_visible
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            queue: send_forum_messages
      target:
        type: Value
        value: 42
```

{% endraw %}
