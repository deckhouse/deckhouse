                    **This feature is available in Enterprise Edition.**

                    Specifies the cleanup method to be applied to the PV's subdirectory content before deletion.
                    By default, the NFS CSI driver simply deletes the directory created for the Persistent Volume (PV) on the NFS server without performing any data cleanup.
                    When volumeCleanup is enabled, the driver will erase each file in the PV directory.

                    Valid options are:
                    - `Discard`: Uses the filesystem's discard (trim) functionality to free data blocks. This option is available only when supported, for example with NFSv4.2.
                    - `RandomFillSinglePass`: Overwrites the content of each file once with random data before deletion. This is implemented by invoking the utility `shred`.
                    - `RandomFillThreePass`: Overwrites the content of each file three times with random data before deletion. This is implemented by invoking the utility `shred`.
                  enum:
                    - Discard
