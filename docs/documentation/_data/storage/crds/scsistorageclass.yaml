                  - `Discard`: Sends a SCSI TRIM or discard command to the device, marking the blocks as free without necessarily overwriting
                    the data. This option is typically faster but may not securely erase data.
                  - `RandomFillSinglePass`: Overwrites the entire device with random data in a single pass.
                    This option is not recommended for solid-state drives, as it reduces the lifespan of the drive.
                  - `RandomFillThreePass`: Overwrites the device with random data in three separate passes.
                    This option is not recommended for solid-state drives, as it reduces the lifespan of the drive.
