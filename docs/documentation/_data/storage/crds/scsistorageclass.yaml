                  Reclaim policy defines the policy for reclaiming the SCSI device when the PersistentVolume is deleted.

                  VolumeCleanup defines the policy for cleaning up the SCSI device when the PersistentVolume is deleted. If ommited, no cleanup will be performed.

                  - **Discard**: 
                    Sends a SCSI TRIM or discard command to the device, marking the blocks as free without necessarily overwriting
                    the data. This option is typically faster but may not securely erase data.

                  - **RandomFillSinglePass**: 
                    Overwrites the entire device with random data in a single pass.
                    This option is not recommended for solid-state drives, as it reduces the lifespan of the drive.

                  - **RandomFillThreePass**: 
                    Overwrites the device with random data in three separate passes.
                    This option is not recommended for solid-state drives, as it reduces the lifespan of the drive.
