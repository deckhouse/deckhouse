Deckhouse supports working with S3-based object storage, enabling its use in Kubernetes for storing data as volumes. The [GeeseFS](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs) file system is used, running via FUSE on top of S3, allowing S3 storage to be mounted as standard file systems.

This page provides instructions for setting up S3 storage in Deckhouse, including connection, creating a StorageClass, and verifying system functionality.

## System Requirements

- Kubernetes version 1.17+ with support for privileged containers.
- A configured S3 storage with available access keys.
- Sufficient memory on nodes. `GeeseFS` uses caching for working with files retrieved from S3. The cache size is set using the `maxCacheSize` parameter in [S3StorageClass](../../../reference/cr/s3storageclass/). Stress test results: 7 nodes, 600 pods and PVCs, `maxCacheSize` = 500 MB, each pod writes 300 MB, reads it, and then terminates.

## Setup and Configuration

Note that all commands must be executed on a machine with administrative privileges in the Kubernetes API.

Required steps:
- Enable the module;
- Create [S3StorageClass](../../../reference/cr/s3storageclass/).

### Enabling the module

To support working with S3 storage, enable the `csi-s3` module, which allows the creation of StorageClass and Secret in Kubernetes using custom resources like [S3StorageClass](../../../reference/cr/s3storageclass/).  
After enabling the module, the following will occur on cluster nodes:
- CSI driver registration;
- Launch of `csi-s3` service pods and creation of necessary components.

```yaml
d8 k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ModuleConfig
metadata:
  name: csi-s3
spec:
  enabled: true
  version: 1
EOF
```

Wait for the module to transition to the `Ready` state.

```shell
d8 k get module csi-s3 -w
```

### Creating StorageClass

The module is configured via the [S3StorageClass](../../../reference/cr/s3storageclass/) manifest. Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: csi.s3.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: S3StorageClass
metadata:
  name: example-s3
spec:
  bucketName: example-bucket
  endpoint: https://s3.example.com
  region: us-east-1
  accessKey: <your-access-key>
  secretKey: <your-secret-key>
  maxCacheSize: 500
```

If `bucketName` is empty then bucket in S3 will be created for each PV. If `bucketName` is not empty then folder inside the bucket will be created for each PV. If the specifies bucket does not exist it will be created.

### Checking module health

To verify the moduleâ€™s functionality, check the status of the pods in the `d8-csi-s3` namespace. Use the following command:

```shell
d8 k -n d8-csi-s3 get pod -owide -w
```

All pods should have the status `Running` or `Completed` and should be deployed across all nodes.

## Known limitations of GeeseFS mounter

S3 is not a traditional file system, so it comes with several limitations. POSIX compatibility depends on the mounting module used and the specific S3 provider. Some storage backends may not guarantee data consistency. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/gaul/are-we-consistent-yet#observed-consistency).

You can check the POSIX compatibility matrix [here](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs#posix-compatibility-matrix).

Key limitations:

- File permissions, symbolic links, user-defined `mtimes`, and special files (block/character devices, named pipes, UNIX sockets) are not supported.
- Special file support is enabled by default for `Yandex S3` but disabled for other providers.
- File permissions are disabled by default.
- User-defined modification times are also disabled: `ctime`, `atime`, and `mtime` are always the same.
- The file modification time cannot be set manually (e.g., using `cp --preserve`, `rsync -a`, or `utimes(2)`).
- Hard links are not supported.
- File locking is not supported.
- "Invisible" deleted files are not retained. If an application keeps an open file descriptor after deleting a file, it will receive `ENOENT` errors when trying to access it.
- The default file size limit is 1.03 TB, achieved through chunking: 1000 parts of 5 MB, 1000 parts of 25 MB, and 8000 parts of 125 MB. The chunk size can be adjusted, but AWS enforces a maximum file size of 5 TB.

## Known bugs

- The requested PVC volume size does not affect the created S3 bucket.
- `df -h` always reports the mounted storage size as 1 PB, and `used` does not change during usage.
- The CSI driver does not validate storage access credentials. Even with incorrect keys, the pod will remain in `Running` status, and PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim will be `Bound`. Any attempt to access the mounted directory within the pod will result in the pod restarting.
