**Storage Configuration** is a critical step in deploying and managing a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring reliable data storage and availability for applications. In this chapter, you will explore the key approaches and tools provided by the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform for configuring and managing storage.

Deckhouse supports a wide range of storage solutions, including **Local Persistent Volumes**, **Ceph**, **NFS**, as well as integration with enterprise storage systems (**Yadro.Tatlin**, **Huawei Dorado**, **HPE 3PAR**), **S3**, **generic SCSI**, and others. In this section you will learn how to configure these types of storages according to infrastructure demands.
