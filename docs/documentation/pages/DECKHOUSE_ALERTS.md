The page displays a list of all alerts of monitoring in the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform.

Alerts are grouped by modules. To the right of the alert name, there are icons indicating the minimum DKP edition in which the alert is available, and the alert severity.

For each alert, a summary is provided, and if available, the detailed alert description can be viewed by expanding it.
