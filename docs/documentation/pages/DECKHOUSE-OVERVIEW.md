Welcome to the home page of the Deckhouse Kubernetes cluster management platform documentation! We recommend starting with the [Getting started]({% if site.mode == 'local' %}{{ site.urls[page.lang] }}{% endif %}/gs/) guide for those who haven't yet tried the platform. It provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the platform to any infrastructure.

Here are some tips on how to find what you need:
- Note that the documentation is version-specific and may differ from version to version. You can select the Deckhouse version in the drop-down list at the top right of the page.
- If you know what you're looking for exactly, use the search box at the top of the page.
- Check [this list](revision-comparison.html) if you are looking for information on a particular module.
- The menu on the left is for searching by scope. Try to guess which section might contain what you are looking for.

Can't find what you were looking for? Don't give up. Visit our [Telegram channel]({{ site.social_links[page.lang]['telegram'] }}) for help! There you will definitely find an answer to your problem.
