Welcome to the home page of the Deckhouse Kubernetes cluster management platform documentation! We recommend starting with the [Getting started]({{ site.url }}/gs/) guide for those who haven't yet tried the platform. It provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the platform to any infrastructure.

Here are some tips on how to find what you need:
<ul>
<li>Note that the documentation is version-specific and may differ from version to version. You can select the Deckhouse version in the drop-down list at the top right of the page.</li>
<li>If you know what you're looking for exactly, use the search box at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Check <a href="revision-comparison.html">this list</a> if you are looking for information on a particular module.</li>
<li>The menu on the left is for searching by scope. Try to guess which section might contain what you are looking for.
