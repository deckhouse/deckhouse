Welcome to the home page of the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform documentation! We recommend starting with the [Getting started]({% if site.mode == 'module' %}{{ site.urls[page.lang] }}{% endif %}/gs/) guide for those who haven't yet tried the platform. It provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the platform to any infrastructure.

Here are some tips on how to find what you need:
- Note that the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform documentation for different versions may vary. Select the version you need from the drop-down list at the top of the page. The list contains up-to-date versions of the documentation.
- If you know what you're looking for exactly, use the search.
- Check [this list](revision-comparison.html) if you are looking for information on a particular module.
- The menu on the left is for searching by scope.
