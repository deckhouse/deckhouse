title: Automatic distribution of secrets across namespaces

Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform (DKP) lets you automatically distribute secrets across all namespaces in the cluster.
This helps eliminate the need to manually copy secrets in CI/CD pipelines — for example,
when pulling container images or working with Ceph RBD storage.

## How it works

- Deckhouse monitors secrets in the `default` namespace
  that have the special label `secret-copier.deckhouse.io/enabled: ""`.
- These secrets are automatically copied to all namespaces in the cluster.
- When the original secret in the `default` namespace is updated, the new content is propagated to all namespaces.
- If the original secret in `default` is deleted, all of its copies in other namespaces are also deleted.
- If a secret copy is manually modified in a namespace,
  it will be automatically overwritten with the content of the original secret from `default`.
- When new namespaces are created,
  all secrets from `default` labeled with `secret-copier.deckhouse.io/enabled: ""` are automatically copied into them.
- There's a regular nightly synchronization that ensures all secrets remain up to date.

### Incompatibility with multitenancy mode

The automatic secret distribution mechanism is not compatible with the [multitenancy mode](../../multitenancy.html).

Multitenancy mode creates isolated environments for users within projects.
Automatically distributing secrets to all namespaces may violate this security model.
If sensitive data accidentally reaches a user’s isolated environment, it may lead to data exposure.

If you need to provide a shared certificate (for example, a wildcard certificate for an internal environment)
or a shared registry access token, do not use automatic distribution.
Instead, include such secrets in the project template.
A cluster administrator must define them in the project configuration.

## Configuring automatic secret distribution

1. Create a Secret resource in the `default` namespace.
1. Add the label `secret-copier.deckhouse.io/enabled: ""`.
1. Apply the resource using the `d8 k apply` command.
   It will then be automatically distributed to all namespaces.

{% alert level="warning" %}
Only secrets from the `default` namespace are automatically distributed.
Secrets with the label `secret-copier.deckhouse.io/enabled: ""` created in any other namespace
will be automatically deleted.
{% endalert %}

## Distributing secrets to selected namespaces

To copy a secret to specific namespaces only,
use the annotation with a label selector `secret-copier.deckhouse.io/target-namespace-selector: "app=custom"`.
In this case, the secret will be copied only to namespaces that match the specified selector.
