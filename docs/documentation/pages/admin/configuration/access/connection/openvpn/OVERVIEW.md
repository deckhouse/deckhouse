This section describes how to configure access to cluster resources using OpenVPN with certificate-based authentication.

Settings are available through a simple web interface that allows you to:

- Issue certificates;
- Revoke certificates;
- Undo certificate revocation;
- Download a ready-to-use user configuration file.

OpenVPN is integrated with [user authentication](../../authentication/), enabling access control for the web interface.
