This section describes how to work with image registries and editions in Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform.

## Working with image registries

This section describes working with image registries in a running cluster. If you are interested in information about working with the registry when installing the cluster, go to the [Installing the Platform](../../../installing/) section.

The section [Third-party registry](../registry/third-party.html) describes the process of switching a running DKP cluster to use a third-party registry.
The section [Internal registry](../registry/internal.html) describes preparing to switch between cluster operating modes: with or without using the internal container image registry, as well as the switching processes.
The section [Restoring registry access](../registry/restore-token.html) describes the process for resuming Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform image downloads after a license token has expired is described.

## Working with editions

The section [Switching editions](../registry/switching-editions.html) describes the possible options for switching editions in a running Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform cluster.
