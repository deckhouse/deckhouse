Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform (DKP) can be deployed in various public clouds,
enabling the use of scalable infrastructure and flexible integration with cloud services.

DKP supports the following providers:

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](./amazon/authorization.html)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](./gcp/connection-and-authorization.html)
- [Microsoft Azure](./azure/authorization.html)
- [OpenStack](./openstack/connection-and-authorization.html)
- [OVH Cloud](./ovh/connection-and-authorization.html)
- [Selectel Cloud](./selectel/connection-and-authorization.html)
- [VK Cloud](./vk/connection-and-authorization.html)
- [Yandex Cloud](./yandex/authorization.html)

This simplifies the choice of deployment environment
and enables a unified approach to managing Kubernetes clusters across different cloud ecosystems.
