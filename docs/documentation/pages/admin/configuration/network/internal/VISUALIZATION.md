To visualize network interactions in the cluster between pods, services, and external resources,
as well as to monitor activity and identify network issues, use the [`cilium-hubble`](/modules/cilium-hubble/) module.

Once you enable the module, the network stack visualization becomes available through the [Hubble](../../../../user/web/hubble.html) web interface.
