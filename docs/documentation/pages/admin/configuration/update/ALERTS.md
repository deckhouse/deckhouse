title: Configuring notifications on new releases

Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform (DKP) generates [alerts](#alerts-in-the-monitoring-system) in the monitoring system
and can automatically send notifications about upcoming minor updates to external systems.
This helps you plan updates and prepare for them in advance.

Conditions for sending notifications to external systems:

- DKP is operating in [automatic update mode](configuration.html#automatic-update-mode).
- A minor version update is planned (notifications are not sent for patch versions).
- A webhook for notifications is configured.

## Alerts in the monitoring system

If an update requires making changes to the cluster (for example, updating the Kubernetes or OS version),
DKP generates designated alerts.
These alerts include:

- **D8NodeHasDeprecatedOSVersion**: Nodes with an unsupported OS version have been detected in the cluster.
- **HelmReleasesHasResourcesWithDeprecatedVersions**: Some Helm releases use deprecated resources.
- **KubernetesVersionEndOfLife**: The installed Kubernetes version is no longer supported.

If any of these alerts appear, make sure to resolve them before updating.
This helps avoid disruptions and ensures the cluster remains stable after the update.

## Configuring notifications

To enable notifications via a configured webhook,
specify the following parameters in the [`update.notification`](/modules/deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-notification) section of the `deckhouse` module:

- `update.notification.webhook`: URL for sending notifications.
  A POST request with update information is sent as soon as a new minor version appears on the selected release channel,
  but before the update is installed in the cluster.
- `update.notification.auth`: Authentication parameters for calling the webhook.
  If this parameter is not set, authentication is not used.
  - `update.notification.auth.basic`: Basic authentication.
    The username and password are passed in the `Authorization` header as `Basic <base64(username:password)>`.
    - `update.notification.auth.basic.username`: Username.
    - `update.notification.auth.basic.password`: Password.
  - `update.notification.auth.bearerToken`: Token-based authentication.
    The token is passed in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.
- `update.notification.minimalNotificationTime`: Minimum interval between the appearance of a new minor version
  on the selected release channel and the start of the update.
  Specified in hours and minutes: `30m`, `1h`, `2h30m`, `24h`.
  If an [update window](configuration.html#update-windows) is configured,
  the update will be applied only after the `minimalNotificationTime` has elapsed and within the defined window.
- `update.notification.tlsSkipVerify`: Disables TLS certificate verification when calling the webhook
  (for example, if a self-signed certificate is used).
  Set to `false` by default.

Example `update.notification` configuration using basic authentication:

```yaml
update:
  notification:
    webhook: https://release-webhook.mydomain.com
    minimalNotificationTime: 4h
    auth:
      basic:
        username: myusername
        password: mypassword
    tlsSkipVerify: true
```

## Notification format

When the conditions for sending notifications are met,
DKP sends a POST request to the specified webhook with the header `Content-Type: application/json`.

Example request body:

```json
{
  "version": "1.68",
  "requirements":  {"k8s": "1.29.0"},
  "changelogLink": "https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-v1.68.md",
  "applyTime": "2025-02-01T14:30:00Z00:00",
  "message": "New Deckhouse Release 1.68 is available. Release will be applied at: Wednesday, 05-Feb-25 14:30:00 UTC"
}
```

Field descriptions:

- `version`: Minor version number (a string).
- `requirements`: Object with requirements for the new version (for example, the minimum Kubernetes version).
- `changelogLink`: Link to the changelog describing changes in the new minor version.
- `applyTime`: Scheduled update date and time in RFC3339 format with the configured update windows considered.
- `message`: A short text notification about the available minor version and its scheduled installation time.
