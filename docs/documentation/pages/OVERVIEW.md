Welcome to the home page of the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform documentation.
{% if site.mode != 'module' %}We recommend starting with the [Getting started](/products/kubernetes-platform/gs/) guide for those who haven't yet tried the platform. It provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the platform to any infrastructure.{% endif %}

Here are some tips on how to find what you need:

- If you know what you're looking for exactly, use the search.
- Check [this list](reference/revision-comparison.html) if you are looking for information on a particular module.
- The menu on the left is for searching by scope.

{% if site.mode != 'module' %}Note that the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform documentation for different versions may vary. Select the version you need from the drop-down list at the top of the page. The list contains up-to-date versions of the documentation.{% endif %}
