## How do I find out all Deckhouse parameters?

Deckhouse is configured using global settings, module settings, and various custom resources. Read more in [theÂ documentation](./).

To view global Deckhouse settings:

```shell
kubectl get mc global -o yaml
```

To list the status of all modules (available for Deckhouse version 1.47+):

```shell
kubectl get modules
```

To get the `user-authn` module configuration:

```shell
kubectl get moduleconfigs user-authn -o yaml
```

## How do I find the documentation for the version installed?

The documentation for the Deckhouse version running in the cluster is available at `documentation.<cluster_domain>`, where `<cluster_domain>` is the DNS name that matches the template defined in the [modules.publicDomainTemplate](deckhouse-configure-global.html#parameters-modules-publicdomaintemplate) parameter.

{% alert level="warning" %}
Documentation is available when the [documentation](modules/810-documentation/) module is enabled. It is enabled by default except the `Minimal` [bundle](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-bundle).
{% endalert %}

## Deckhouse update

### How to find out in which mode the cluster is being updated?

You can view the cluster update mode in the [configuration](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html) of the `deckhouse` module. To do this, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get mc deckhouse -oyaml
```

Example of the output:

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ModuleConfig
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-12-14T11:13:03Z"
  generation: 1
  name: deckhouse
  resourceVersion: "3258626079"
  uid: c64a2532-af0d-496b-b4b7-eafb5d9a56ee
spec:
  settings:
    releaseChannel: Stable
    update:
      windows:
      - days:
        - Mon
        from: "19:00"
        to: "20:00"
  version: 1
status:
  state: Enabled
  status: ""
  type: Embedded
  version: "1"
```

There are three possible update modes:
* **Automatic + update windows are not set.** The cluster will be updated after the new version appears on the corresponding [release channel](deckhouse-release-channels.html).
* **Automatic + update windows are set.** The cluster will be updated in the nearest available window after the new version appears on the release channel.
* **Manual.** [Manual action](modules/002-deckhouse/usage.html#manual-update-confirmation) is required to apply the update.

### How do I set the desired release channel?

Change (set) the [releaseChannel](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel) parameter in the `deckhouse` module [configuration](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html) to automatically switch to another release channel.

It will activate the mechanism of [automatic stabilization of the release channel](#how-does-automatic-deckhouse-update-work).

Here is an example of the `deckhouse` module configuration with the `Stable` release channel:

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ModuleConfig
metadata:
  name: deckhouse
spec:
  version: 1
  settings:
    releaseChannel: Stable
```

### How do I disable automatic updates?

To completely disable the Deckhouse update mechanism, remove the [releaseChannel](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel) parameter in the `deckhouse` module [configuration](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html).

In this case, Deckhouse does not check for updates and even doesn't apply patch releases.

{% alert level="danger" %}
It is highly not recommended to disable automatic updates! It will block updates to patch releases that may contain critical vulnerabilities and bugs fixes.
{% endalert %}

### How do I apply an update without having to wait for the update window, canary-release and manual update mode?

To apply an update immediately, set the `release.deckhouse.io/apply-now : "true"` annotation on the [DeckhouseRelease](cr.html#deckhouserelease) resource.

{% alert level="info" %}
**Caution!** In this case, the update windows, settings [canary-release](modules/002-deckhouse/cr.html#deckhouserelease-v1alpha1-spec-applyafter) and [manual cluster update mode](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-disruptionapprovalmode) will be ignored. The update will be applied immediately after the annotation is installed.
{% endalert %}

An example of a command to set the annotation to skip the update windows for version `v1.56.2`:

```shell
kubectl annotate deckhousereleases v1.56.2 release.deckhouse.io/apply-now="true"
```

An example of a resource with the update window skipping annotation in place:

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: DeckhouseRelease
metadata:
  annotations:
    release.deckhouse.io/apply-now: "true"
...
```

### How to understand what changes the update contains and how it will affect the cluster?

You can find all the information about Deckhouse versions in the list of [Deckhouse releases](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/releases).

Summary information about important changes, component version updates, and which components in the cluster will be restarted during the update process can be found in the description of the zero patch version of the release. For example, [v1.46.0](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/releases/tag/v1.46.0) for the v1.46 Deckhouse release.

A detailed list of changes can be found in the Changelog, which is referenced in each [release](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/releases).

### How do I understand that the cluster is being updated?

During the update:
- The `DeckhouseUpdating` alert is firing.
- The `deckhouse` Pod is not the `Ready` status. If the Pod does not go to the `Ready` status for a long time, then this may indicate that there are problems in the work of Deckhouse. Diagnosis is necessary.

### How do I know that the update was successful?

If the `DeckhouseUpdating` alert is resolved, then the update is complete.

You can also check the status of Deckhouse [releases](cr.html#deckhouserelease).

An example:

```console
$ kubectl get deckhouserelease
NAME       PHASE        TRANSITIONTIME   MESSAGE
v1.46.8    Superseded   13d              
v1.46.9    Superseded   11d              
v1.47.0    Superseded   4h12m            
v1.47.1    Deployed     4h12m            
```

The `Deployed` status of the corresponding version indicates that the switch to the corresponding version was performed (but this does not mean that it ended successfully).

Check the status of the Deckhouse Pod:

```shell
$ kubectl -n d8-system get pods -l app=deckhouse
NAME                   READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE
deckhouse-7844b47bcd-qtbx9  1/1   Running  0       1d
```

* If the status of the Pod is `Running`, and `1/1` indicated in the READY column, the update was completed successfully.
* If the status of the Pod is `Running`, and `0/1` indicated in the READY column, the update is not over yet. If this goes on for more than 20-30 minutes, then this may indicate that there are problems in the work of Deckhouse. Diagnosis is necessary.
* If the status of the Pod is not `Running`, then this may indicate that there are problems in the work of Deckhouse. Diagnosis is necessary.

{% alert level="info" %}
Possible options for action if something went wrong:
- Check Deckhouse logs using the following command:

  ```shell
  kubectl -n d8-system logs -f -l app=deckhouse | jq -Rr 'fromjson? | .msg'
  ```

- [Collect debugging information](modules/002-deckhouse/faq.html#how-to-collect-debug-info) and contact technical support.
- Ask for help from the [community](https://deckhouse.io/community/about.html).
{% endalert %}

### How do I know that a new version is available for the cluster?

As soon as a new version of Deckhouse appears on the release channel installed in the cluster:
- The alert `DeckhouseReleaseIsWaitingManualApproval` fires, if the cluster uses manual update mode (the [update.mode](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-mode) parameter is set to `Manual`).
- There is a new custom resource [DeckhouseRelease](cr.html#deckhouserelease). Use the `kubectl get deckhousereleases` command, to view the list of releases. If the `DeckhouseRelease` is in the `Pending` state, the specified version has not yet been installed. Possible reasons why `DeckhouseRelease` may be in `Pending`:
  - Manual update mode is set (the [update.mode](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-mode) parameter is set to `Manual`).
  - The automatic update mode is set, and the [update windows](modules/002-deckhouse/usage.html#update-windows-configuration) are configured, the interval of which has not yet come.
  - The automatic update mode is set, update windows are not configured, but the installation of the version has been postponed for a random time due to the mechanism of reducing the load on the repository of container images. There will be a corresponding message in the `status.message` field of the `DeckhouseRelease` resource.
  - The [update.notification.minimalNotificationTime](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-notification-minimalnotificationtime) parameter is set, and the specified time has not passed yet.

### How do I get information about the upcoming update in advance?

You can get information in advance about updating minor versions of Deckhouse on the release channel in the following ways:
- Configure manual [update mode](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-mode). In this case, when a new version appears on the release channel, the alert `DeckhouseReleaseIsWaitingManualApproval` will fire and a new custom resource [DeckhouseRelease](cr.html#deckhouserelease) will appear in the cluster.
- Configure automatic [update mode](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-mode) and specify the minimum time in the [minimalNotificationTime](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-notification-minimalnotificationtime) parameter for which the update will be postponed. In this case, when a new version appears on the release channel, a new custom resource [DeckhouseRelease](cr.html#deckhouserelease) will appear in the cluster. And if you specify a URL in the [update.notification.webhook](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update-notification-webhook) parameter, then the webhook will be called additionally.

### How do I find out which version of Deckhouse is on which release channel?

Information about which version of Deckhouse is on which release channel can be obtained at <https://flow.deckhouse.io>.

### How does automatic Deckhouse update work?

Every minute Deckhouse checks a new release appeared in the release channel specified by the [releaseChannel](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel) parameter.

When a new release appears on the release channel, Deckhouse downloads it and creates CustomResource [DeckhouseRelease](cr.html#deckhouserelease).

After creating a `DeckhouseRelease` custom resource in a cluster, Deckhouse updates the `deckhouse` Deployment and sets the image tag to a specified release tag according to [selected](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update) update mode and update windows (automatic at any time by default).

To get list and status of all releases use the following command:

```shell
kubectl get deckhousereleases
```

{% alert %}
Patch releases (e.g., an update from version `1.30.1` to version `1.30.2`) ignore update windows settings and apply as soon as they are available.
{% endalert %}

### What happens when the release channel changes?

* When switching to a **more stable** release channel (e.g., from `Alpha` to `EarlyAccess`), Deckhouse downloads release data from the release channel (the `EarlyAccess` release channel in the example) and compares it with the existing `DeckhouseReleases`:
  * Deckhouse deletes *later* releases (by semver) that have not yet been applied (with the `Pending` status).
  * if *the latest* releases have been already Deployed, then Deckhouse will hold the current release until a later release appears on the release channel (on the `EarlyAccess` release channel in the example).
* When switching to a less stable release channel (e.g., from `EarlyAcess` to `Alpha`), the following actions take place:
  * Deckhouse downloads release data from the release channel (the `Alpha` release channel in the example) and compares it with the existing `DeckhouseReleases`.
  * Then Deckhouse performs the update according to the [update parameters](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-update).

![The scheme of using the releaseChannel parameter during Deckhouse installation and operation](images/common/deckhouse-update-process.png)
{% endofftopic %}

### What do I do if Deckhouse fails to retrieve updates from the release channel?

* Make sure that the desired release channel is [configured](#how-do-i-set-the-desired-release-channel).
* Make sure that the DNS name of the Deckhouse container registry is resolved correctly.

  Retrieve and compare the IP addresses of the Deckhouse container registry (`registry.deckhouse.io`) on one of the nodes and in the Deckhouse pod. They should match.
  
  Here is how you can retrieve the IP address of the Deckhouse container registry on a node:

  ```shell
  $ getent ahosts registry.deckhouse.io
  46.4.145.194    STREAM registry.deckhouse.io
  46.4.145.194    DGRAM
  46.4.145.194    RAW
  ```

  Here is how you can retrieve the IP address of the Deckhouse container registry in a pod:
  
  ```shell
  $ kubectl -n d8-system exec -ti deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- getent ahosts registry.deckhouse.io
  46.4.145.194    STREAM registry.deckhouse.io
  46.4.145.194    DGRAM  registry.deckhouse.io
  ```
  
  If the retrieved IP addresses do not match, inspect the DNS settings on the host. Specifically, check the list of domains in the `search` parameter of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file (it affects name resolution in the Deckhouse pod). If the `search` parameter of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file includes a domain where wildcard record resolution is configured, it may result in incorrect resolution of the IP address of the Deckhouse container registry (see example).
  
{% offtopic title="Example of DNS settings that may cause errors in resolving the IP address of the Deckhouse container registry..." %}

In the example below, DNS settings produce different results when resolving names on the host and in the Kubernetes pod:
- The `/etc/resolv.conf` file on the node:

  ```text
  nameserver 10.0.0.10
  search company.my
  ```

  > Note that the `ndot` parameter defaults to 1 (`options ndots:1`) on the node. But in Kubernetes pods, the `ndot` parameter is set to **5**.
Therefore, the logic for resolving DNS names with 5 dots or less in the name is different on the host and in the pod.

- The `company.my` DNS zone is configured to resolve wildcard records `*.company.my` to `10.0.0.100`. That is, any DNS name in the `company.my` zone for which there is no specific DNS entry is resolved to `10.0.0.100`.

In this case, subject to the `search` parameter specified in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file, when accessing the `registry.deckhouse.io` address **on the node**, the system will try to obtain the IP address for the `registry.deckhouse.io` name (it treats it as a fully qualified name given the default setting of `options ndots:1`).

On the other hand, when accessing `registry.deckhouse.io` **from a Kubernetes pod**, given the `options ndots:5` parameter (the default one in Kubernetes) and the `search` parameter, the system will initially try to resolve the IP address for the `registry.deckhouse.io.company.my` name. The `registry.deckhouse.io.company.my` name will be resolved to `10.0.0.100` because the `company.my` DNS zone is configured to resolve wildcard records `*.company.my` to `10.0.0.100`. As a result, the `registry.deckhouse.io` host and information about the available Deckhouse updates will be unreachable.

## Air-gapped environment; working via proxy and third-party registry

### How do I configure Deckhouse to use a third-party registry?

{% alert level="warning" %}
This feature is available in Enterprise Edition only.
{% endalert %}

{% alert level="warning" %}
Deckhouse only supports Bearer authentication for container registries.

Tested and guaranteed to work with the following container registries:
{%- for registry in site.data.supported_versions.registries %}
[{{- registry[1].shortname }}]({{- registry[1].url }})
{%- unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}
{%- endfor %}.
{% endalert %}

Deckhouse can be configured to work with a third-party registry (e.g., a proxy registry inside private environments).

Define the following parameters in the `InitConfiguration` resource:

* `imagesRepo: <PROXY_REGISTRY>/<DECKHOUSE_REPO_PATH>/ee`. The path to the Deckhouse EE image in the third-party registry, for example `imagesRepo: registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee`;
* `registryDockerCfg: <BASE64>`. Base64-encoded auth credentials of the third-party registry.

Use the following `registryDockerCfg` if anonymous access to Deckhouse images is allowed in the third-party registry:

```json
{"auths": { "<PROXY_REGISTRY>": {}}}
```

`registryDockerCfg` must be Base64-encoded.

Use the following `registryDockerCfg` if authentication is required to access Deckhouse images in the third-party registry:

```json
{"auths": { "<PROXY_REGISTRY>": {"username":"<PROXY_USERNAME>","password":"<PROXY_PASSWORD>","auth":"<AUTH_BASE64>"}}}
```

* `<PROXY_USERNAME>` â auth username for `<PROXY_REGISTRY>`.
* `<PROXY_PASSWORD>` â auth password for `<PROXY_REGISTRY>`.
* `<PROXY_REGISTRY>` â registry address: `<HOSTNAME>[:PORT]`.
* `<AUTH_BASE64>` â Base64-encoded `<PROXY_USERNAME>:<PROXY_PASSWORD>` auth string.

`registryDockerCfg` must be Base64-encoded.

The `InitConfiguration` resource provides two more parameters for non-standard third-party registry configurations:

* `registryCA` - root CA certificate to validate the third-party registry's HTTPS certificate (if self-signed certificates are used);
* `registryScheme` - registry scheme (`HTTP` or `HTTPS`). The default value is `HTTPS`.

### Tips for configuring Nexus

The following requirements must be met if the [Nexus](https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-public) repository manager is used:

* `Docker Bearer Token Realm` must be enabled (*Administration* -> *Security* -> *Realms*).
* Docker **proxy** repository must be pre-created (*Administration* -> *Repository* -> *Repositories*):
  * `Allow anonymous docker pull` must be enabled. This option enables Bearer token authentication to work. Note that anonymous access [won't work](https://help.sonatype.com/en/docker-authentication.html#unauthenticated-access-to-docker-repositories) unless explicitly enabled in *Administration* -> *Security* -> *Anonymous Access*, and the `anonymous` user is not granted access rights to the created repository.
  * `Maximum metadata age` for the created repository must be set to `0`.
* Access control must be configured as follows:
  * The **Nexus** role must be created (*Administration* -> *Security* -> *Roles*) with the following permissions:
    * `nx-repository-view-docker-<repo>-browse`
    * `nx-repository-view-docker-<repo>-read`
  * The user (*Administration* -> *Security* -> *Users*) must be created with the above role granted.

**Configuration**:

* Enable `Docker Bearer Token Realm` (*Administration* -> *Security* -> *Realms*):
  ![Enable `Docker Bearer Token Realm`](images/registry/nexus/nexus-realm.png)

* Create a docker **proxy** repository (*Administration* -> *Repository* -> *Repositories*) pointing to the [Deckhouse registry](https://registry.deckhouse.io/):
  ![Create docker proxy repository](images/registry/nexus/nexus-repository.png)

* Fill in the fields on the Create page as follows:
  * `Name` must contain the name of the repository you created earlier, e.g., `d8-proxy`.
  * `Repository Connectors / HTTP` or `Repository Connectors / HTTPS` must contain a dedicated port for the created repository, e.g., `8123` or other.
  * `Allow anonymous docker pull` must be enabled for the Bearer token authentication to work. Note that anonymous access [won't work](https://help.sonatype.com/en/docker-authentication.html#unauthenticated-access-to-docker-repositories) unless explicitly enabled in *Administration* -> *Security* -> *Anonymous Access* and the `anonymous` user is not granted access rights to the created repository.
  * `Remote storage` must be set to `https://registry.deckhouse.io/`.
  * You can disable `Auto blocking enabled` and `Not found cache enabled` for debugging purposes, otherwise they must be enabled.
  * `Maximum Metadata Age` must be set to `0`.
  * `Authentication` must be enabled if you plan to use Deckhouse Enterprise Edition and the related fields must be set as follows:
    * `Authentication Type` must be set to `Username`.
    * `Username` must be set to `license-token`.
    * `Password` must contain your license key for Deckhouse Enterprise Edition.

  ![Repository settings example 1](images/registry/nexus/nexus-repo-example-1.png)
  ![Repository settings example 2](images/registry/nexus/nexus-repo-example-2.png)
  ![Repository settings example 3](images/registry/nexus/nexus-repo-example-3.png)

* Configure Nexus access control to allow Nexus access to the created repository:
  * Create a **Nexus** role (*Administration* -> *Security* -> *Roles*) with the `nx-repository-view-docker-<repo>-browse` and `nx-repository-view-docker-<repo>-read` permissions.

    ![Create a Nexus role](images/registry/nexus/nexus-role.png)

  * Create a user with the role above granted.

### Tips for configuring Harbor

You need to use the Proxy Cache feature of a [Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor).

* Create a Registry:
  * `Administration -> Registries -> New Endpoint`.
  * `Provider`: `Docker Registry`.
  * `Name` â specify any of your choice.
  * `Endpoint URL`: `https://registry.deckhouse.io`.
  * Specify the `Access ID` and `Access Secret` for Deckhouse Enterprise Edition.

  ![Create a Registry](images/registry/harbor/harbor1.png)

* Create a new Project:
  * `Projects -> New Project`.
  * `Project Name` will be used in the URL. You can choose any name, for example, `d8s`.
  * `Access Level`: `Public`.
  * `Proxy Cache` â enable and choose the Registry, created in the previous step.

  ![Create a new Project](images/registry/harbor/harbor2.png)

Thus, Deckhouse images will be available at `https://your-harbor.com/d8s/deckhouse/ee:{d8s-version}`.

### Manually uploading images to an air-gapped registry

{% alert level="warning" %}
This feature is only available in Standard Edition (SE), Enterprise Edition (EE), and Certified Security Edition (CSE).
{% endalert %}

{% alert level="info" %}
Check [releases.deckhouse.io](https://releases.deckhouse.io) for the current status of the release channels.
{% endalert %}

1. [Download and install the Deckhouse CLI tool](deckhouse-cli/).

1. Pull Deckhouse images using the `d8 mirror pull` command.

   By default, `d8 mirror` pulls only the latest available patch versions for every actual Deckhouse release and the current set of officially supplied modules.
   For example, for Deckhouse 1.59, only version `1.59.12` will be pulled, since this is sufficient for updating Deckhouse from 1.58 to 1.59.

   Run the following command (specify the edition code and the license key) to download actual images:

   ```shell
   d8 mirror pull \
     --source='registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/<EDITION>' \
     --license='<LICENSE_KEY>' $(pwd)/d8.tar
   ```

   where:
   - `<EDITION>` â the edition code of the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform (for example, `ee`, `se`, `cse`);
   - `<LICENSE_KEY>` â Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform license key.

   > If the loading of images is interrupted, rerunning the command will resume the loading if no more than a day has passed since it stopped.

   You can also use the following command options:
   - `--no-pull-resume` â to forcefully start the download from the beginning;
   - `--no-modules` â to skip downloading modules;
   - `--min-version=X.Y` â to download all versions of Deckhouse starting from the specified minor version. This parameter will be ignored if a version higher than the version on the Rock Solid updates channel is specified. This parameter cannot be used simultaneously with the `--release` parameter;
   - `--release=X.Y.Z` â to download only a specific version of Deckhouse (without considering update channels). This parameter cannot be used simultaneously with the `--min-version` parameter;
   - `--gost-digest` â for calculating the checksum of the Deckhouse images in the format of GOST R 34.11-2012 (Streebog). The checksum will be displayed and written to a file with the extension `.tar.gostsum` in the folder with the tar archive containing Deckhouse images;
   - `--source` â to specify the address of the Deckhouse source registry;
      - To authenticate in the official Deckhouse image registry, you need to use a license key and the `--license` parameter;
      - To authenticate in a third-party registry, you need to use the `--source-login` and `--source-password` parameters;
   - `--images-bundle-chunk-size=N` â to specify the maximum file size (in GB) to split the image archive into. As a result of the operation, instead of a single file archive, a set of `.chunk` files will be created (e.g., `d8.tar.NNNN.chunk`). To upload images from such a set of files, specify the file name without the `.NNNN.chunk` suffix in the `d8 mirror push` command (e.g., `d8.tar` for files like `d8.tar.NNNN.chunk`).

   Example of a command to download all versions of Deckhouse EE starting from version 1.59 (provide the license key):

   ```shell
   d8 mirror pull \
     --source='registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee' \
     --license='<LICENSE_KEY>' --min-version=1.59 $(pwd)/d8.tar
   ```

   Example of a command for downloading Deckhouse images from a third-party registry:

   ```shell
   d8 mirror pull \
     --source='corp.company.com:5000/sys/deckhouse' \
     --source-login='<USER>' --source-password='<PASSWORD>' $(pwd)/d8.tar
   ```

1. Upload the bundle with the pulled Deckhouse images to a host with access to the air-gapped registry and install the [Deckhouse CLI](deckhouse-cli/) tool.

1. Push the images to the air-gapped registry using the `d8 mirror push` command.

   Example of a command for pushing images from the `/tmp/d8-images/d8.tar` tarball (specify authorization data if necessary):

   ```shell
   d8 mirror push /tmp/d8-images/d8.tar 'corp.company.com:5000/sys/deckhouse' \
     --registry-login='<USER>' --registry-password='<PASSWORD>'
   ```

   > Before pushing images, make sure that the path for loading into the registry exists (`/sys/deckhouse` in the example above), and the account being used has write permissions.

1. Once pushing images to the air-gapped private registry is complete, you are ready to install Deckhouse from it. Refer to the [Getting started](/gs/bm-private/step2.html) guide.

   When launching the installer, use a repository where Deckhouse images have previously been loaded instead of official Deckhouse registry. For example, the address for launching the installer will look like `corp.company.com:5000/sys/deckhouse/install:stable` instead of `registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee/install:stable`.

   During installation, add your registry address and authorization data to the [InitConfiguration](installing/configuration.html#initconfiguration) resource (the [imagesRepo](installing/configuration.html#initconfiguration-deckhouse-imagesrepo) and [registryDockerCfg](installing/configuration.html#initconfiguration-deckhouse-registrydockercfg) parameters; you might refer to [step 3]({% if site.mode == 'module' %}{{ site.urls[page.lang] }}{% endif %}/gs/bm-private/step3.html) of the Getting started guide as well).

   After installation, apply DeckhouseReleases manifests that were generated by the `d8 mirror pull` command to your cluster via Deckhouse CLI as follows:

   ```shell
   d8 k apply -f ./deckhousereleases.yaml
   ```

### Manually uploading images of Deckhouse modules into an air-gapped registry

Follow these steps for manual loading images of modules, connected from the module source (the [ModuleSource](cr.html#modulesource) resource):

1. [Download and install the Deckhouse CLI tool](deckhouse-cli/).

1. Create an authentication string for `registry.deckhouse.io` using the following command (provide the license key):

   ```shell

1. Pull module images from their source registry, defined as a `ModuleSource` resource, into a dedicated directory using the `d8 mirror modules pull` command.

   `d8 mirror modules pull` pulls only the module versions available in the module release channels at the time of copying unless the `--modules-filter` flag is set.

   - Create a file with the `ModuleSource` resource (for example, `$HOME/module_source.yml`).

     Below is an example of a ModuleSource resource:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
     kind: ModuleSource
     metadata:
       name: deckhouse
     spec:
       registry:
         # Specify credentials for the official Deckhouse registry obtained in step 2.
         dockerCfg: <BASE64_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS>
         repo: registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee/modules
         scheme: HTTPS
       # Select the appropriate release channel: Alpha, Beta, EarlyAccess, Stable, or RockSolid
       releaseChannel: "Stable"
     ```

   - Download module images from the source described in the `ModuleSource` resource to the specified directory, using the command `d8 mirror modules pull`.

     An example of a command:

     ```shell
     d8 mirror modules pull -d ./d8-modules -m $HOME/module_source.yml
     ```

     To download only a specific set of modules of specific versions, use the `--modules-filter` flag followed by the list of required modules and their versions separated by the `;` character.

     For example:

     ```shell
     d8 mirror modules pull -d /tmp/d8-modules -m $HOME/module_source.yml \
       --modules-filter='deckhouse-admin:v1.0.0;deckhouse-admin:v1.3.3; sds-drbd:v0.0.1'
     ```

1. Upload the directory with the pulled images of the Deckhouse modules to a host with access to the air-gapped registry and install [Deckhouse CLI](deckhouse-cli/) tool.

1. Upload module images to the air-gapped registry using the `d8 mirror modules push` command.

   Below is an example of a command for pushing images from the `/tmp/d8-modules` directory:

   ```shell
   d8 mirror modules push \
     -d /tmp/d8-modules --registry='corp.company.com:5000/deckhouse-modules' \
     --registry-login='<USER>' --registry-password='<PASSWORD>'
   ```

   > Before pushind images, make sure that the path for loading into the registry exists (`/deckhouse-modules` in the example above), and the account being used has write permissions.

1. After uploading the images to the air-gapped registry, edit the `ModuleSource` YAML manifest prepared in step 3:

   * Change the `.spec.registry.repo` field to the address that you specified in the `--registry` parameter when you uploaded the images;
   * Change the `.spec.registry.dockerCfg` field to a base64 string with the authorization data for your registry in `dockercfg` format. Refer to your registry's documentation for information on how to obtain this token.

   An example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleSource
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     registry:
       # Specify the authentication string for your registry.
       dockerCfg: <BASE64_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS>
       repo: 'corp.company.com:5000'
       scheme: HTTPS
     # Select the appropriate release channel: Alpha, Beta, EarlyAccess, Stable, or RockSolid
     releaseChannel: "Stable"
   ```

1. Apply the `ModuleSource` manifest you got in the previous step to the cluster.

   ```shell
   d8 k apply -f $HOME/module_source.yml
   ```

   Once the manifest has been applied, the modules are ready for use. For more detailed instructions on configuring and using modules, please refer to the [module developer's documentation]({% if site.mode == 'module' %}{{ site.urls[page.lang] }}/documentation/latest{% endif %}/module-development/).

### How do I switch a running Deckhouse cluster to use a third-party registry?

{% alert level="warning" %}
Using a registry other than `registry.deckhouse.io` and `registry.deckhouse.ru` is only available in the EnterpriseÂ Edition.
{% endalert %}

To switch the Deckhouse cluster to using a third-party registry, follow these steps:

* Run `deckhouse-controller helper change-registry` inside the Deckhouse Pod with the new registry settings.
  * Example:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec -ti -n d8-system deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller helper change-registry --user MY-USER --password MY-PASSWORD registry.example.com/deckhouse
    ```

  * If the registry uses a self-signed certificate, put the root CA certificate that validates the registry's HTTPS certificate to file `/tmp/ca.crt` in the Deckhouse Pod and add the `--ca-file /tmp/ca.crt` option to the script or put the content of CA into a variable as follows:

    ```shell
    $ CA_CONTENT=$(cat <<EOF
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    CERTIFICATE
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    CERTIFICATE
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    EOF
    )
    $ kubectl exec  -n d8-system deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- bash -c "echo '$CA_CONTENT' > /tmp/ca.crt && deckhouse-controller helper change-registry --ca-file /tmp/ca.crt --user MY-USER --password MY-PASSWORD registry.example.com/deckhouse/ee"
    ```

  * To view the list of available keys of the `deckhouse-controller helper change-registry` command, run the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec -ti -n d8-system deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller helper change-registry --help
    ```

    Example output:

    ```shell
    usage: deckhouse-controller helper change-registry [<flags>] <new-registry>
    
    Change registry for deckhouse images.
    
    Flags:
    --help               Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
    --user=USER          User with pull access to registry.
    --password=PASSWORD  Password/token for registry user.
    --ca-file=CA-FILE    Path to registry CA.
    --insecure           Use HTTP while connecting to new registry.
    --dry-run            Don't change deckhouse resources, only print them.
    --new-deckhouse-tag=NEW-DECKHOUSE-TAG
    New tag that will be used for deckhouse deployment image (by default
    current tag from deckhouse deployment will be used).
    
    Args:
    <new-registry>  Registry that will be used for deckhouse images (example:
    registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ce). By default, https will be used, if you need
    http - provide '--insecure' flag
    ```

* Wait for the Deckhouse Pod to become `Ready`. Restart Deckhouse Pod if it will be in `ImagePullBackoff` state.
* Wait for bashible to apply the new settings on the master node. The bashible log on the master node (`journalctl -u bashible`) should contain the message `Configuration is in sync, nothing to do`.
* If you want to disable Deckhouse automatic updates, remove the [releaseChannel](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel) parameter from the `deckhouse` module configuration.
* Check if there are Pods with original registry in cluster (if there are â restart them):

  ```shell
  kubectl get pods -A -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.containers[] | select((.image | contains("deckhouse.io"))))
    | .metadata.namespace + "\t" + .metadata.name' -r
  ```

### How to bootstrap a cluster and run Deckhouse without the usage of release channels?

This method should only be used if there are no release channel images in your air-gapped registry.

* If you want to install Deckhouse with automatic updates disabled:
  * Use the tag of the installer image of the corresponding version. For example, use the image `your.private.registry.com/deckhouse/install:v1.44.3`, if you want to install release `v1.44.3`.
  * Set the corresponding version number in the [deckhouse.devBranch](installing/configuration.html#initconfiguration-deckhouse-devbranch) parameter of the `InitConfiguration` resource.
  * **Do not** set the [deckhouse.releaseChannel](installing/configuration.html#initconfiguration-deckhouse-releasechannel) parameter of the `InitConfiguration` resource.
* If you want to disable automatic updates for an already installed Deckhouse (including patch release updates), then delete the [releaseChannel](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel) parameter from the `deckhouse` module configuration.

### Using a proxy server

{% alert level="warning" %}
This feature is available in Enterprise Edition only.
{% endalert %}

{% offtopic title="Example of steps for configuring a Squid-based proxy server..." %}
* Prepare the VM for setting up the proxy. The machine must be accessible to the nodes that will use it as a proxy and be connected to the Internet.
* Install Squid on the server (here and further examples for Ubuntu):

  ```shell
  apt-get install squid
  ```

* Create a config file:

  ```shell
  cat <<EOF > /etc/squid/squid.conf
  auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid3/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwords
  auth_param basic realm proxy
  acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED
  http_access allow authenticated

  # Choose the port you want. Below we set it to default 3128.
  http_port 3128
  ```

* Create a user for proxy-server authentication:

  Example for the user `test` with the password `test` (be sure to change):

  ```shell
  echo "test:$(openssl passwd -crypt test)" >> /etc/squid/passwords
  ```

* Start squid and enable the system to start it up automatically:

  ```shell
  systemctl restart squid
  systemctl enable squid
  ```

{% endofftopic %}

Use the [proxy](installing/configuration.html#clusterconfiguration-proxy) parameter of the `ClusterConfiguration` resource to configure proxy usage.

An example:

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1
kind: ClusterConfiguration
clusterType: Cloud
cloud:
  provider: OpenStack
  prefix: main
podSubnetCIDR: 10.111.0.0/16
serviceSubnetCIDR: 10.222.0.0/16
kubernetesVersion: "Automatic"
cri: "Containerd"
clusterDomain: "cluster.local"
proxy:
  httpProxy: "http://user:password@proxy.company.my:3128"
  httpsProxy: "https://user:password@proxy.company.my:8443"
```

## Changing the configuration

### How do I change the configuration of a cluster?

The general cluster parameters are stored in the [ClusterConfiguration](installing/configuration.html#clusterconfiguration) structure.

To change the general cluster parameters, run the command:

```shell
kubectl -n d8-system exec -ti deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller edit cluster-configuration
```

After saving the changes, Deckhouse will bring the cluster configuration to the state according to the changed configuration. Depending on the size of the cluster, this may take some time.

### How do I change the configuration of a cloud provider in a cluster?

Cloud provider setting of a cloud of hybrid cluster are stored in the `<PROVIDER_NAME>ClusterConfiguration` structure, where `<PROVIDER_NAME>` â name/code of the cloud provider. E.g., for an OpenStack provider, the structure will be called [OpenStackClusterConfiguration]({% if site.mode == 'module' and site.d8Revision == 'CE' %}{{ site.urls[page.lang] }}/documentation/v1/{% endif %}modules/030-cloud-provider-openstack/cluster_configuration.html).

Regardless of the cloud provider used, its settings can be changed using the following command:

```shell
kubectl -n d8-system exec -ti deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller edit provider-cluster-configuration
```

### How do I change the configuration of a static cluster?

Settings of a static cluster are stored in the [StaticClusterConfiguration](installing/configuration.html#staticclusterconfiguration) structure.

To change the settings of a static cluster, run the command:

```shell
kubectl -n d8-system exec -ti deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller edit static-cluster-configuration
```

### How to switch Deckhouse EE to CE?

{% alert level="warning" %}
The instruction implies using the public address of the container registry: `registry.deckhouse.io`. Using a registry other than `registry.deckhouse.io` and `registry.deckhouse.ru` is only available in the EnterpriseÂ Edition.
{% endalert %}

{% alert level="warning" %}
Deckhouse CE does not support cloud clusters on OpenStack and VMware vSphere.
{% endalert %}

To switch Deckhouse Enterprise Edition to Community Edition, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that the modules used in the cluster [are supported in Deckhouse CE](revision-comparison.html). Disable modules that are not supported in Deckhouse CE.

1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   kubectl exec -ti -n d8-system deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller helper change-registry registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ce
   ```

1. Wait for the Deckhouse Pod to become `Ready`:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n d8-system get po -l app=deckhouse
   ```

1. Restart Deckhouse Pod if it will be in `ImagePullBackoff` state:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n d8-system delete po -l app=deckhouse
   ```

1. Wait for Deckhouse to restart and to complete all tasks in the queue:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n d8-system exec deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller queue main | grep status:
   ```

   Example of output when there are still jobs in the queue (`length 38`):

   ```console
   # kubectl -n d8-system exec deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller queue main | grep status:
   Queue 'main': length 38, status: 'run first task'
   ```

   Example of output when the queue is empty (`length 0`):

   ```console
   # kubectl -n d8-system exec deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller queue main | grep status:
   Queue 'main': length 0, status: 'waiting for task 0s'
   ```

1. On the master node, check the application of the new settings.

   The message `Configuration is in sync, nothing to do` should appear in the `bashible` systemd service log on the master node.

   An example::

   ```console
   # journalctl -u bashible -n 5
   Jan 12 12:38:20 demo-master-0 bashible.sh[868379]: Configuration is in sync, nothing to do.
   Jan 12 12:38:20 demo-master-0 systemd[1]: bashible.service: Deactivated successfully.
   Jan 12 12:39:18 demo-master-0 systemd[1]: Started Bashible service.
   Jan 12 12:39:19 demo-master-0 bashible.sh[869714]: Configuration is in sync, nothing to do.
   Jan 12 12:39:19 demo-master-0 systemd[1]: bashible.service: Deactivated successfully.
   ```

1. Check if there are any Pods left in the cluster with the Deckhouse EE registry address:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -A -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.containers[] | select((.image | contains("deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee"))))
     | .metadata.namespace + "\t" + .metadata.name' -r | sort | uniq
   ```

   Sometimes, some static Pods may remain running (for example, `kubernetes-api-proxy-*`). This is due to the fact that kubelet does not restart the Pod despite changing the corresponding manifest, because the image used is the same for the Deckhouse CE and EE. To make sure that the corresponding manifests have also been changed, run the following command on any master node:

   ```shell
   grep -ri 'deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee' /etc/kubernetes | grep -v backup
   ```

   The output of the command should be empty.

### How to switch Deckhouse CE to EE?

You will need a valid license key (you can [request a trial license key](https://deckhouse.io/products/enterprise_edition.html) if necessary).

{% alert %}
The instruction implies using the public address of the container registry: `registry.deckhouse.io`. If you use a different container registry address, change the commands or use [the instruction](#how-do-i-configure-deckhouse-to-use-a-third-party-registry) for switching Deckhouse to using a third-party registry.
{% endalert %}

To switch Deckhouse Community Edition to Enterprise Edition, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   LICENSE_TOKEN=<PUT_YOUR_LICENSE_TOKEN_HERE>
   kubectl exec -ti -n d8-system deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller helper change-registry --user license-token --password $LICENSE_TOKEN registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee
   ```

1. Wait for the Deckhouse Pod to become `Ready`:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n d8-system get po -l app=deckhouse
   ```

1. Restart Deckhouse Pod if it will be in `ImagePullBackoff` state:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n d8-system delete po -l app=deckhouse
   ```

1. Wait for Deckhouse to restart and to complete all tasks in the queue:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n d8-system exec deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller queue main | grep status:
   ```

   Example of output when there are still jobs in the queue (`length 38`):

   ```console
   # kubectl -n d8-system exec deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller queue main | grep status:
   Queue 'main': length 38, status: 'run first task'
   ```

   Example of output when the queue is empty (`length 0`):

   ```console
   # kubectl -n d8-system exec deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller queue main | grep status:
   Queue 'main': length 0, status: 'waiting for task 0s'
   ```

1. On the master node, check the application of the new settings.

   The message `Configuration is in sync, nothing to do` should appear in the `bashible` systemd service log on the master node.

   An example:

   ```console
   # journalctl -u bashible -n 5
   Jan 12 12:38:20 demo-master-0 bashible.sh[868379]: Configuration is in sync, nothing to do.
   Jan 12 12:38:20 demo-master-0 systemd[1]: bashible.service: Deactivated successfully.
   Jan 12 12:39:18 demo-master-0 systemd[1]: Started Bashible service.
   Jan 12 12:39:19 demo-master-0 bashible.sh[869714]: Configuration is in sync, nothing to do.
   Jan 12 12:39:19 demo-master-0 systemd[1]: bashible.service: Deactivated successfully.
   ```

1. Check if there are any Pods left in the cluster with the Deckhouse CE registry address:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -A -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.containers[] | select((.image | contains("deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ce"))))
     | .metadata.namespace + "\t" + .metadata.name' -r | sort | uniq
   ```

   Sometimes, some static Pods may remain running (for example, `kubernetes-api-proxy-*`). This is due to the fact that kubelet does not restart the Pod despite changing the corresponding manifest, because the image used is the same for the Deckhouse CE and EE. To make sure that the corresponding manifests have also been changed, run the following command on any master node:

   ```shell
   grep -ri 'deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ce' /etc/kubernetes | grep -v backup
   ```

   The output of the command should be empty.

## How do I upgrade the Kubernetes version in a cluster?

To upgrade the Kubernetes version in a cluster change the [kubernetesVersion](installing/configuration.html#clusterconfiguration-kubernetesversion) parameter in the [ClusterConfiguration](installing/configuration.html#clusterconfiguration) structure by making the following steps:
1. Run the command:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n d8-system exec -ti deploy/deckhouse -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller edit cluster-configuration
   ```

1. Change the `kubernetesVersion` field.
1. Save the changes. Cluster nodes will start updating sequentially.
1. Wait for the update to finish. You can track the progress of the update using the `kubectl get no` command. The update is completed when the new version appears in the command's output for each cluster node in the `VERSION` column.

### How do I run Deckhouse on a particular node?

Set the `nodeSelector` [parameter](modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html) of the `deckhouse` module and avoid setting `tolerations`. The necessary values will be assigned to the `tolerations` parameter automatically.

{% alert level="warning" %}
Use only nodes with the **CloudStatic** or **Static** type to run Deckhouse. Also, avoid using a `NodeGroup` containing only one node to run Deckhouse.
{% endalert %}

Here is an example of the module configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
kind: ModuleConfig
metadata:
  name: deckhouse
spec:
  version: 1
  settings:
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.deckhouse.io/deckhouse: ""
```
