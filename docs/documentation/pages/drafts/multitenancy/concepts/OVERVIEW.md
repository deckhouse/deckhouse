The section helps to understand the functionality of the parts of the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform and the approaches used in its operation. The section also explains the purpose of DKP features (answers the question â€” "why is this needed?"). Technical details and descriptions of the implementation of features are covered in the [Architecture](../architecture/) section.

The [Glossary](glossary.html) contains a list of terms used in the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform and helps to understand the context.

Some concepts of the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform are explored in more depth in separate articles in the section:
- [Modules](modules.html)
- [Projects](projects.html)
- [Role-Based Access Control Model](rbac.html)
