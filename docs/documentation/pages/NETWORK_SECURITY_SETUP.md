  Detailed information on configuring network policies for the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform, particularly in environments with constraints on host-to-host network communications. Outlines the necessary conditions to enable tunneling modes for pod traffic using CNI Cilium and Flannel.

If the infrastructure where Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform (DKP) is running has requirements to limit host-to-host network communications, the following conditions must be met:

* Tunneling mode for traffic between pods is enabled ([configuration](modules/cni-cilium/configuration.html#parameters-tunnelmode) for CNI Cilium, [configuration](modules/cni-flannel/configuration.html#parameters-podnetworkmode) for CNI Flannel).
* Traffic between [podSubnetCIDR](installing/configuration.html#clusterconfiguration) encapsulated within a VXLAN is allowed (if inspection and filtering of traffic within a VXLAN tunnel is performed).
* If there is integration with external systems (e.g. LDAP, SMTP or other external APIs), it is required to allow network communication with them.
* Local network communication is fully allowed within each individual cluster node.
* Inter-node communication is allowed on the ports shown in the tables on the current page. Note that most ports are in the 4200-4299 range. When new platform components are added, they will be assigned ports from this range (if it is possible).

{% offtopic title="How to check the current VXLAN port..." %}

```bash
d8 k -n d8-cni-cilium get cm cilium-config -o yaml | grep tunnel
```

Example output:

```console
routing-mode: tunnel
tunnel-port: "4298"
tunnel-protocol: vxlan
```

Changes related to the addition, removal, or reassignment of ports in the tables
are listed in the "Network" section of a respective DKP version on the [Release notes](release-notes.html) page.
