## Deleting a cluster deployed with a cloud provider

Perform the following steps to delete a cluster deployed with a cloud provider

1. Find out the update channel set in the cluster. To do this, run the command:

   ```shell
   kubectl get mc deckhouse  -o jsonpath='{.spec.settings.releaseChannel}'
   ```

2. Run the Deckhouse installer:

   ```shell
   docker run --pull=always -it [<MOUNT_OPTIONS>] \
     registry.deckhouse.ru/deckhouse/<DECKHOUSE_REVISION>/install:<RELEASE_CHANNEL> bash
   ```

   where:
   - `<MOUNT_OPTIONS>` — parameters for mounting files in the installer container, such as SSH access keys;
   - `<DECKHOUSE_REVISION>` — the Deckhouse [edition](../revision-comparison.html) (e. g., `ee` — for the Enterprise Edition, `ce` — for the Community Edition, etc.)
   - `<RELEASE_CHANNEL>` — the Deckhouse [release channel](../modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel) in kebab-case. Note that it must match the one set in `config.yml`:
     - `alpha` — for the *Alpha* release channel;
     - `beta` — for the *Beta* release channel;
     - `early-access` — for the *Early Access* release channel;
     - `stable` — for the *Stable* release channel;
     - `rock-solid` — for the *Rock Solid* release channel.

   Below is an example command to run the Deckhouse CE installer container:

   ```shell
   docker run -it --pull=always \
     -v "$PWD/dhctl-tmp:/tmp/dhctl" \
     -v "$HOME/.ssh/:/tmp/.ssh/" registry.deckhouse.ru/deckhouse/ce/install:stable bash
   ```

3. In the container you have started, run the following command:

   ```shell
   dhctl destroy --ssh-user=<USER> \
     --ssh-agent-private-keys=/tmp/.ssh/id_rsa \
     --yes-i-am-sane-and-i-understand-what-i-am-doing \
     --ssh-host=<MASTER_IP>
   ```

   where:
   - `<USER>` — the user of the remote machine that ran the installation;
   - `<MASTER_IP>` — the IP address of the cluster's master node.

The installer will then connect to the cluster, retrieve the necessary data, and delete all the resources and objects in the cloud that were created during the DKP installation and operation.

## Deleting a hybrid cluster

Follow these steps to delete a hybrid cluster consisting of the nodes that were automatically deployed in the cloud as well as the static nodes that were manually plugged in:

1. First, [delete](../modules/040-node-manager/faq.html#how-to-clean-up-a-node-for-adding-to-the-cluster) all the [extra nodes](../modules/040-node-manager/cr.html#nodegroup-v1-spec-nodetype) (CloudStatic and Static) that were manually plugged in.

2. Find out the update channel set in the cluster. To do this, run the command:

   ```shell
   kubectl get mc deckhouse  -o jsonpath='{.spec.settings.releaseChannel}'
   ```

3. Run the Deckhouse installer:

   ```shell
   docker run --pull=always -it [<MOUNT_OPTIONS>] \
     registry.deckhouse.ru/deckhouse/<DECKHOUSE_REVISION>/install:<RELEASE_CHANNEL> bash
   ```

   where:
   - `<MOUNT_OPTIONS>` — parameters for mounting files in the installer container, such as SSH access keys;
   - `<DECKHOUSE_REVISION>` — the Deckhouse [edition](../revision-comparison.html) (e. g., `ee` — for the Enterprise Edition, `ce` — for the Community Edition, etc.)
   - `<RELEASE_CHANNEL>` — the Deckhouse [release channel](../modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel) in kebab-case. Note that it must match the one set in `config.yml`:
     - `alpha` — for the *Alpha* release channel;
     - `beta` — for the *Beta* release channel;
     - `early-access` — for the *Early Access* release channel;
     - `stable` — for the *Stable* release channel;
     - `rock-solid` — for the *Rock Solid* release channel.

   Below is an example command to run the Deckhouse CE installer container:

   ```shell
   docker run -it --pull=always \
     -v "$PWD/dhctl-tmp:/tmp/dhctl" \
     -v "$HOME/.ssh/:/tmp/.ssh/" registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ce/install:stable bash
   ```

4. In the container you have started, run the following command:

   ```shell
   dhctl destroy --ssh-user=<USER> \
     --ssh-agent-private-keys=/tmp/.ssh/id_rsa \
     --yes-i-am-sane-and-i-understand-what-i-am-doing \
     --ssh-host=<MASTER_IP>
   ```

   where:
   - `<USER>` — the user of the remote machine that ran the installation;
   - `<MASTER_IP>` — the IP address of the cluster's master node.

The installer will then connect to the cluster, retrieve the necessary data, and delete all the resources and objects in the cloud that were created during the DKP installation and operation.

## Deleting a static cluster

Follow the steps below to delete a cluster that has been manually installed (e.g., on bare metal):

1. [Delete](../modules/040-node-manager/faq.html#how-to-clean-up-a-node-for-adding-to-the-cluster) all the extra nodes from the cluster.

2. Find out the update channel set in the cluster. To do this, run the command:

   ```shell
   kubectl get mc deckhouse  -o jsonpath='{.spec.settings.releaseChannel}'
   ```

3. Run the Deckhouse installer:

   ```shell
   docker run --pull=always -it [<MOUNT_OPTIONS>] \
     registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/<DECKHOUSE_REVISION>/install:<RELEASE_CHANNEL> bash
   ```

   where:
   - `<MOUNT_OPTIONS>` — parameters for mounting files in the installer container, such as SSH access keys;
   - `<DECKHOUSE_REVISION>` — the Deckhouse [edition](../revision-comparison.html) (e.g., `ee` — for the Enterprise Edition, `ce` — for the Community Edition, etc.)
   - `<RELEASE_CHANNEL>` — the Deckhouse [release channel](../modules/002-deckhouse/configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel) in kebab-case. Note that it must match the one set in `config.yml`:
     - `alpha` — for the *Alpha* release channel;
     - `beta` — for the *Beta* release channel;
     - `early-access` — for the *Early Access* release channel;
     - `stable` — for the *Stable* release channel;
     - `rock-solid` — for the *Rock Solid* release channel.

   Below is an example command to run the Deckhouse CE installer container:

   ```shell
   docker run -it --pull=always \
     -v "$PWD/dhctl-tmp:/tmp/dhctl" \
     -v "$HOME/.ssh/:/tmp/.ssh/" registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ce/install:stable bash
   ```

4. Run the command below to delete the cluster:

   ```shell
   dhctl destroy --ssh-user=<USER> \
     --ssh-agent-private-keys=/tmp/.ssh/id_rsa \
     --yes-i-am-sane-and-i-understand-what-i-am-doing \
     --ssh-host=<MASTER_IP>
   ```

   where:
   - `<USER>` — the user of the remote machine that ran the installation;
   - `<MASTER_IP>` — the IP address of the cluster's master node.

The installer will then connect to the master node and delete all Deckhouse and Kubernetes cluster components on it.
