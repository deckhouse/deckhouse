title: "Cloud provider - OpenStack: Layouts"
---

Four layouts are supported. Below is more information about each of them.

## Standard
In this scheme, an internal cluster network is created with a gateway to the public network; the nodes do not have public IP addresses. Note that the floating IP is assigned to the master node.

> **Caution!**
> If the provider does not support SecurityGroups, all applications running on nodes with Floating IPs assigned will be available at a public IP. For example, `kube-apiserver` on master nodes will be available on port 6443. To avoid this, we recommend using the [SimpleWithInternalNetwork](#simplewithinternalnetwork) placement strategy.

## StandardWithNoRouter
An internal cluster network is created that does not have access to the public network. All nodes (including master ones) have two interfaces: the first one to the public network, the second one to the internal network. This layout should be used if you want all nodes in the cluster to be directly accessible.

> **Caution!**
> This strategy does not support a LoadBalancer since a Floating IP is not available for the router-less network. Thus, you cannot provision a load balancer with the Floating IP. An internal load balancer with the virtual IP in the public network is only accessible to cluster nodes.

## Simple

The master node and cluster nodes are connected to the existing network. This placement strategy might come in handy if you need to merge a Kubernetes cluster with existing VMs.

> **Caution!**
> This strategy does not support a LoadBalancer since a Floating IP is not available for the router-less network. Thus, you cannot provision a load balancer with the Floating IP. An internal load balancer with the virtual IP in the public network is only accessible to cluster nodes.

## SimpleWithInternalNetwork

The master node and cluster nodes are connected to the existing network. This placement strategy might come in handy if you need to merge a Kubernetes cluster with existing VMs.

> **Caution!**
> This placement strategy does not involve the management of `SecurityGroups` (it is assumed they were created beforehand).
> To configure security policies, you must explicitly specify both `additionalSecurityGroups` in the `OpenStackClusterConfiguration` for the masterNodeGroup and other nodeGroups, and `additionalSecurityGroups` when creating `OpenStackInstanceClass` in the cluster.
