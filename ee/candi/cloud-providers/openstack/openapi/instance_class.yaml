            Parameters of a group of OpenStack servers used by `machine-controller-manager` (the [node-manager](https://deckhouse.io/en/documentation/v1/modules/040-node-manager/) module).

            The `CloudInstanceClass` resource of the `node-manager` module refers to this resource.

                    Flavor of OpenStack servers.

                    Get a list of all available flavors: `openstack flavor list`.

                    For all non-master nodes it is advisable to use flavor's with a local disk. If cloud provider supports local disks they are usually faster and cheaper. The disadvantage of using such flavors is the inability to migrate nodes between hypervisors.

                    Flavor create example: `openstack flavor create c4m8d50 --ram 8192 --disk 50 --vcpus 4`

                  example: m1.medium

                imageName:
                  description: |
                    Image to use while provisioning OpenStack servers.

                    Use this command to get a list of available images: `openstack image list`.

                    **Caution!** Currently, only `Ubuntu 18.04`, `Ubuntu 20.04` and `Centos 7` are supported and tested to work.

                    **By default:** either `OpenStackCloudDiscoveryData` value or `instances.imageName` is used.

                  description: |
                    The size of a root disk (in gigabytes).
                    This parameter also has influence on type of volume that will be used for root disk; the ["How to use rootDiskSize and when it is preferred"](https://deckhouse.io/en/documentation/v1/modules/030-cloud-provider-openstack/faq.html#how-to-use-rootdisksize-and-when-it-is-preferred) section describes how to use it.

                  description: |
                    Path to the network that VirtualMachines' primary NICs will connect to (default gateway).

                    **By default:** the value from `OpenStackCloudDiscoveryData` is used.
                  example: k8s-msk-178

                    Paths to networks that VirtualMachines' secondary NICs will connect to.

                    **By default:** the value from `OpenStackCloudDiscoveryData` is used.
                  example:

                  description: |
                    Security groups that will be applied to VM's network ports in addition to security groups set in a cloud provider configuration.

                    They allow you to set firewall rules for provisioned instances.

                    The `SecurityGroups` may not be supported by the cloud provider.
                  example:
                  - "security-group-1"
                  - "security-group-2"

                  description: |
                    The additional tags to attach to the instances created (in addition to those specified in the cloud provider configuration).
                  example:
