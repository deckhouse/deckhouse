### Prepare an operating system image

Operating system vendors typically provide special cloud builds of their operating systems for use in virtualization environments. These builds typically contain virtual hardware drivers, cloud-init, virtualization guest agents, and are distributed as IMG or QCOW2 disk images. We recommend that you use these cloud images as the OS on the nodes in your clusters.

The cloud image of the operating system must be placed in the _Images -> Template Images_ section of the Dynamix portal. Follow these steps to upload the OS image to the storage:

If the infrastructure does not have a DNS server, access to the Dynamix portal from the cluster 
Dynamix portal from the cluster can be organized by adding the IP address and domains associated 
with the Dynamix portal to the cloud-init template for generating the hosts file.
This template is located in the /etc/cloud/templates/ folder. The name of the template depends on the OS. 

CAUTION!!! After adding data to hosts and before creating the template from the virtual machine, you must run the `cloud-init clean` command.
