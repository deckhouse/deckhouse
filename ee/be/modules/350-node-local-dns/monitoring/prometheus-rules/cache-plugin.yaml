        description: |
          The `success` cache in node-local-dns is evicting entries frequently (>100 in 5 minutes).

          This could mean there are too many different DNS records application have to resolve (to many Services?). So, node-local-dns cache capacity is too small (`success 39936` is currently configured), or traffic patterns changed.

          Affected node: `{{$labels.node}}`

        summary: node-local-dns denial cache is being frequently evicted.
        description: |
          The `denial` (NXDOMAIN) cache in node-local-dns is evicting entries frequently.

          This might indicate that there are Services that are being recreated too often in cluster. So, denial cache size is not enough (`denial 9984` is currently configured).
