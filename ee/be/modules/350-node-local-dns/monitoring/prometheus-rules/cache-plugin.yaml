        summary: node-local-dns success cache is being frequently evicted.
        description: |
          The `success` cache in node-local-dns is evicting entries frequently (>100 in 5 minutes).

          This could mean cache capacity is too small (e.g. `success 39936`), or traffic patterns changed.

          Affected node: `{{$labels.node}}`

        description: |
          The `denial` (NXDOMAIN) cache in node-local-dns is evicting entries frequently.

          This might indicate denial cache size is insufficient (e.g. `denial 9984`).
