title: "Cloud provider â€” zVirt"
---

The `cloud-provider-zvirt` module is responsible for interacting with the zVirt resources. It allows the [node manager](../../modules/040-node-manager/) module to use zVirt resources for provisioning nodes for the specified [node group](../../modules/040-node-manager/cr.html#nodegroup) (a group of nodes that are acted upon as if they were a single entity).
