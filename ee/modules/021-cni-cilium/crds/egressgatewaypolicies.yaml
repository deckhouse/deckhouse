                                A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                                relates the key and values.

                                    operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.

                                    the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,

                              matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
                              map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                              operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
