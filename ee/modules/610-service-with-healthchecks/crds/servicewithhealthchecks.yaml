                  value), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field.

                  Normally, the IP address is randomly assigned to the service.
                  If the IP address is manually specified, it must be within the valid range (specified by the system configuration) and free for assignment; otherwise, service creation will fail.

                  This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed
                  to `ExternalName` (which requires this field to be blank) or the type
                  field is being changed from `ExternalName` (in which case this field may
                  optionally be specified, as describe above).

                  Valid values are `None`,
                  empty string (""), or a valid IP address. Setting this to `None` makes a
                  "headless service" (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint
                  connections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies to
                  types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified
                  when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail.
                  This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.

                  Describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
                  receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                  ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs).
                  If set to `Local`, the proxy will configure
                  the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                  of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                  traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                  the client source IP. Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                  be dropped.

                  The default value, `Cluster`, uses the standard behavior of
                  routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                  features).

                  Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                  within the cluster will always get `Cluster` semantics, but clients sending to
                  a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                  when picking a node.

                  This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and

                  in-range, and is not in use, it will be used.

                  If not specified, a value
                  will be automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers)
                  can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for this
                  service or not.

                  If this field is specified when creating a Service
                  which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped
                  when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).

                  This field cannot be updated once set.

                  dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints.

              ipFamilies:
                description: |-
                  A family of IP addresses (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) assigned to a service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster
                  configuration and the `ipFamilyPolicy` field.

                  If this field is specified
                  manually, the requested family is available in the cluster,
                  and `ipFamilyPolicy` allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of
                  the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows
                  for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow
                  changing the primary IP family of the Service.

                  Valid values are `IPv4`
                  and `IPv6`.This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,
                  NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to "headless" services.

                  This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type `ExternalName`.

                  This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in
                  either order).
                  These families must correspond to the values of the
                  `clusterIPs` field, if specified. Both `clusterIPs` and `ipFamilies` are
                  governed by the `ipFamilyPolicy` field.

                  If there is no value provided, then this field will be set
                  to `SingleStack`. Services can be `SingleStack` (a single IP family),
                  `PreferDualStack` (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or
                  a single IP family on single-stack clusters), or `RequireDualStack`
                  (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail).

                  The
                  `ipFamilies` and `clusterIPs` fields depend on the value of this field. This
                  field will be wiped when updating a service to type `ExternalName`.

                  If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an optional prefix,
                  e.g. `internal-vip` or `example.com/internal-vip`. Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.

                  This field can only be set when the Service type is `LoadBalancer`.

                  If not set, the default load
                  balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration,
                  but should apply for any default implementation.

                  If set, it is assumed that a load balancer
                  implementation is watching for Services with a matching class.
                  Any default load balancer
                  implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.
                  This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type `LoadBalancer`.

                  Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non `LoadBalancer` type.

                  This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying
                  the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created.

                  This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.

                  load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs.

                  This field will be ignored if the

                  The Kubernetes controllers that generate `Endpoints` and `EndpointSlice` resources for

                  Pods themselves are not.
                  Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                  through the `Endpoints` or `EndpointSlice` resources can safely assume this behavior.

                  Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                  options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.

                  ClusterIP allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                  to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the `selector` or if that is not
                  specified, by manual construction of an `Endpoints` object or
                  `EndpointSlice` objects.

                  If `clusterIP` is `None`, no virtual IP is
                  allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                  than a virtual IP.

                  NodePort builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                  routes to the same endpoints as the `clusterIP`.

                  LoadBalancer builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                  (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                  as the `clusterIP`.

                  ExternalName aliases this service to the specified `externalName`.
                  Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
