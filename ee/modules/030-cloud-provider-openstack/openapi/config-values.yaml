      Specifies additional networks that can be connected to the VM. `cloud-controller-manager` uses them to insert `ExternalIP` to `.status.addresses` field in the Node API object.

      If you have instances in the cluster that use External Networks (other than those set out in the placement strategy), you must pass them via the `additionalExternalNetworkNames` parameter.

    description: |
      Setting for backwards compatibility. Enable if the cloud OpenStack version is less than 3.34 and you get error "Version 3.34 is not supported by the API. Minimum is 3.0 and maximum is 3.x" when ordering a PV. This will disable volumes online resize, but will restore ability to order new PVs.

  podNetworkMode:
    type: string
    description: |
      Sets the traffic mode for the network that the pods use to communicate with each other (usually, it is an internal network; however, there can be exceptions):
        * `DirectRouting` — means that there is a direct routing between the nodes.
        * `DirectRoutingWithPortSecurityEnabled` — direct routing is enabled between the nodes, but only if  the range of addresses of the internal network is explicitly allowed in OpenStack for Ports.
          * **Caution!** Make sure that the `username` can edit AllowedAddressPairs on Ports connected to the `internalNetworkName` network. Generally, an OpenStack user doesn't have such a privilege if the network has the `shared` flag set.
        * `VXLAN` — direct routing between the nodes isn't available; VXLAN should be used.
    enum: ["DirectRouting", "DirectRoutingWithPortSecurityEnabled", "VXLAN"]

          * the first (in lexicographic order) StorageClass created by the module (in accordance with the order in OpenStack).
