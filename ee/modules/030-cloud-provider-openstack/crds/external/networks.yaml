                    Known .status.conditions.type are: "Available", "Progressing"

                    Available represents the availability of the OpenStack resource. If it is
                    true then the resource is ready for use.

                    Progressing indicates whether the controller is still attempting to
                    reconcile the current state of the OpenStack resource to the desired
                    state. Progressing will be False either because the desired state has
                    been achieved, or because some terminal error prevents it from ever being
                    achieved and the controller is no longer attempting to reconcile. If
                    Progressing is True, an observer waiting on the resource should continue
                    to wait.
