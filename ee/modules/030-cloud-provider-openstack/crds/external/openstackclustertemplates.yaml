                          management and workload clusters or when the management cluster is inside the
                          project network.
                          This option requires that the API server use a VIP on the cluster network so that the
                          underlying machines can change without changing ControlPlaneEndpoint.Host.
                          When using a managed load balancer, this VIP will be managed automatically.
                          If not using a managed load balancer, cluster configuration will fail without additional
                          configuration to manage the VIP on the control plane machines, which falls outside of
                          the scope of this controller.
