                                cpuPolicy is used to pin the virtual CPUs (vCPUs) of instances to the
                                host's physical CPU cores (pCPUs). Host aggregates should be used to
                                separate these pinned instances from unpinned instances as the latter
                                will not respect the resourcing requirements of the former.

                                Permitted values are shared (the default), and dedicated.

                                shared: The guest vCPUs will be allowed to freely float across host
                                pCPUs, albeit potentially constrained by NUMA policy.

                                dedicated: The guest vCPUs will be strictly pinned to a set of host
                                pCPUs. In the absence of an explicit vCPU topology request, the
                                drivers typically expose all vCPUs as sockets with one core and one
                                thread. When strict CPU pinning is in effect the guest CPU topology
                                will be setup to match the topology of the CPUs to which it is
                                pinned. This option implies an overcommit ratio of 1.0. For example,
                                if a two vCPU guest is pinned to a single host core with two threads,
                                then the guest will get a topology of one socket, one core, two
                                threads.

                                architecture be used. SMT-based architectures include Intel
                                processors with Hyper-Threading technology. In these architectures,
                                processor cores share a number of components with one or more other
                                cores. Cores in such architectures are commonly referred to as
                                hardware threads, while the cores that a given core share components
                                with are known as thread siblings.

                                Permitted values are prefer (the default), isolate, and require.

                                prefer: The host may or may not have an SMT architecture. Where an
                                SMT architecture is present, thread siblings are preferred.

                                isolate: The host must not have an SMT architecture or must emulate a
                                non-SMT architecture. If the host does not have an SMT architecture,
                                each vCPU is placed on a different core as expected. If the host does
                                have an SMT architecture - that is, one or more cores have thread
                                siblings - then each vCPU is placed on a different physical core. No
                                vCPUs from other guests are placed on the same core. All but one
                                thread sibling on each utilized core is therefore guaranteed to be
                                unusable.

                                require: The host must have an SMT architecture. Each vCPU is
                                allocated on thread siblings. If the host does not have an SMT
                                architecture, then it is not used. If the host has an SMT
                                architecture, but not enough cores with free thread siblings are
                                available, then scheduling fails.

                    Available represents the availability of the OpenStack resource. If it is
                    true then the resource is ready for use.

                    Progressing indicates whether the controller is still attempting to
                    reconcile the current state of the OpenStack resource to the desired
                    state. Progressing will be False either because the desired state has
                    been achieved, or because some terminal error prevents it from ever being
                    achieved and the controller is no longer attempting to reconcile. If
                    Progressing is True, an observer waiting on the resource should continue
                    to wait.
