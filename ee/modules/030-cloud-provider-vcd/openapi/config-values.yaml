          The name of StorageClass that will be used in the cluster by default.

          If the parameter is omitted, the default StorageClass is either:
            
          * an arbitrary StorageClass present in the cluster that has the default annotation;
          * StorageClass for `default StorageProfile`;
          * the first StorageClass created by the module.
          
          **Warning.** Specifying a value different from the one currently used (in the existing PVC) will result in disk re-provisioning and all data will be deleted.
