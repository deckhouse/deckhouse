description: Multitenancy and Projects in Kubernetes. The multitenancy-manager module in Deckhouse allows creating projects for various development teams with the ability to subsequently deploy applications in them.
---
## Description

The module enables the creation of projects in a Kubernetes cluster. **Project** is an isolated environment where applications can be deployed.

## Why is this needed?

The standard `Namespace` resource, used for logical resource separation in Kubernetes, does not provide necessary functionalities, hence it is not an isolated environment:
* [Resource consumption by pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) is not limited by default;
* [Network communication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) with other pods works by default from any point in the cluster;
* Unrestricted access to node resources: address space, network space, mounted host directories.

The configuration capabilities of `Namespace` do not fully meet modern development requirements. By default, the following features are not included for `Namespace`:
* Log collection;
* Audit;
* Vulnerability scanning.

The functionality of projects allows addressing these issues.

## Advantages of the module

For platform administrators:
* **Consistency**: Administrators can create projects using the same template, ensuring consistency and simplifying management.
* **Security**: Projects provide isolation of resources and access policies between different projects, supporting a secure multitenant environment.
* **Resource Consumption**: Administrators can easily set quotas on resources and limitations for each project, preventing excessive resource usage.

For platform users:
* **Isolation**: Each project provides an isolated environment where developers can deploy and test their applications without impacting other projects.
* **Quick Start**: Developers can request projects created from ready-made templates from administrators, allowing for a quick start to developing a new application.

## Internal Logic

To create projects, the following [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) are used:
* [ProjectTemplate](cr.html#projecttemplate) — a resource that describes the project template. It defines a list of resources to be created in the project and a schema for parameters that can be passed when creating the project;
* [Project](cr.html#project) — a resource that describes a specific project.

When creating a [Project](cr.html#project) resource from a specific [ProjectTemplate](cr.html#projecttemplate), the following happens:
1. The [parameters](cr.html#project-v1alpha2-spec-parameters) passed are validated against the OpenAPI specification (the [openAPI](cr.html#projecttemplate-v1alpha1-spec-parametersschema) parameter of [ProjectTemplate](cr.html#projecttemplate));
1. Rendering of the [resources template](cr.html#projecttype-v1alpha1-spec-resourcestemplate) is performed using [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/). Values for rendering are taken from the [template](cr.html#project-v1alpha2-spec-template) parameter of the [Project](cr.html#project) resource;
1. A `Namespace` is created with a name matching the name of [Project](cr.html#project);
1. All resources described in the template are created in sequence.

> **Attention!** When changing the project template, all created projects will be updated according to the new template.
