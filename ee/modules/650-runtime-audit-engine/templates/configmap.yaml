        # @- [Description]
        #
        # This is an index that controls the dimension of the syscall buffers.
        # The syscall buffer is the shared space between Falco and its drivers where all the syscall events
        # are stored.
        # Falco uses a syscall buffer for every online CPU, and all these buffers share the same dimension.
        # So this parameter allows you to control the size of all the buffers!
        #
        # @- [Usage]
        #
        # You can choose between different indexes: from `1` to `10` (`0` is reserved for future uses).
        # Every index corresponds to a dimension in bytes:
        #
        # [(*), 1 MB, 2 MB, 4 MB, 8 MB, 16 MB, 32 MB, 64 MB, 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB]
        #   ^    ^     ^     ^     ^     ^      ^      ^       ^       ^       ^
        #   |    |     |     |     |     |      |      |       |       |       |
        #   0    1     2     3     4     5      6      7       8       9       10
        #
        # As you can see the `0` index is reserved, while the index `1` corresponds to
        # `1 MB` and so on.
        #
        # These dimensions in bytes derive from the fact that the buffer size must be:
        # (1) a power of 2.
        # (2) a multiple of your system_page_dimension.
        # (3) greater than `2 * (system_page_dimension)`.
        #
        # According to these constraints, it is possible that sometimes you cannot use all the indexes, let's consider an
        # example to better understand it:
        # If you have a `page_size` of 1 MB the first available buffer size is 4 MB because 2 MB is exactly
        # `2 * (system_page_size)` -> `2 * 1 MB`, but this is not enough we need more than `2 * (system_page_size)`!
        # So from this example, it is clear that if you have a page size of 1 MB the first index that you can use is `3`.
        #
        # Please note: this is a very extreme case just to let you understand the mechanism, usually the page size is something
        # like 4 KB so you have no problem at all, and you can use all the indexes (from `1` to `10`).
        #
        # To check your system page size, use the Falco `@page-size` command line option. The output on a system with a page
        # size of 4096 Bytes (4 KB) should be the following:
        #
        # "Your system page size is: 4096 bytes."
        #
        # @- [Suggestions]
        #
        # Before the introduction of this param the buffer size was fixed to 8 MB (so index `4`, as you can see
        # in the default value below).
        # You can increase the buffer size when you face syscall drops. A size of 16 MB (so index `5`) can reduce
        # syscall drops in production-heavy systems without noticeable impact. Very large buffers, however, could
        # slow down the entire machine.
        # On the other side, you can try to reduce the buffer size to speed up the system, but this could
        # increase the number of syscall drops!
        # As a final remark, consider that the buffer size is mapped twice in the process' virtual memory, so a buffer of 8 MB
        # will result in a 16 MB area in the process virtual memory.
        # Please pay attention when you use this parameter and change it only if the default size doesn't fit your use case.
        # @ This is an index that controls the dimension of the syscall buffers.

    # Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to pass
    # system call information. When Falco detects that this buffer is
    # full and system calls have been dropped, it can take one or more of
    # the following actions:
    #   - ignore: do nothing (default when list of actions is empty)
    #   - log: log a DEBUG message noting that the buffer was full
    #   - alert: emit a Falco alert noting that the buffer was full
    #   - exit: exit Falco with a non-zero rc
    #
    # Notice it is not possible to ignore and log/alert messages at the same time.
    #
    # The rate at which log/alert messages are emitted is governed by a
    # token bucket. The rate corresponds to one message every 30 seconds
    # with a burst of one message (by default).
    #
    # The messages are emitted when the percentage of dropped system calls

    # Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to receive
    # the events (eg., system call information) in userspace.
    #
    # Anyways, the underlying libraries can also timeout for various reasons.
    # For example, there could have been issues while reading an event.
    # Or the particular event needs to be skipped.
    # Normally, it's very unlikely that Falco does not receive events consecutively.
    #
    # Falco is able to detect such uncommon situation.
    #
    # Here you can configure the maximum number of consecutive timeouts without an event
    # after which you want Falco to alert.
    # By default this value is set to 1000 consecutive timeouts without an event at all.
    # How this value maps to a time interval depends on the CPU frequency.

    syscall_event_timeouts:
      # @ Maximum number of consecutive timeouts without an event
      # after which you want Falco to alert.
      max_consecutives: 1000

    # Falco continuously monitors outputs performance. When an output channel does not allow
    # to deliver an alert within a given deadline, an error is reported indicating
    # which output is blocking notifications.
    # The timeout error will be reported to the log according to the above log_* settings.
    # Note that the notification will not be discarded from the output queue; thus,
    # output channels may indefinitely remain blocked.
    # An output timeout error indeed indicate a misconfiguration issue or I/O problems
    # that cannot be recovered by Falco and should be fixed by the user.
    #
    # The "output_timeout" value specifies the duration in milliseconds to wait before
    # considering the deadline exceed.
    #
    # With a 2000ms default, the notification consumer can block the Falco output
    # for up to 2 seconds without reaching the timeout.
    # @ Duration in milliseconds to wait before considering the output timeout deadline exceed.
    output_timeout: 2000

    # A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
    # rate of Falco notifications. One rate limiter is assigned to each event
    # source, so that alerts coming from one can't influence the throttling
    # mechanism of the others. This is controlled by the following options:
    #  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
    #    gained per second. When 0, the throttling mechanism is disabled.
    #    Defaults to 0.
    #  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
    #
    # With these defaults, the throttling mechanism is disabled.
    # For example, by setting rate to 1 Falco could send up to 1000 notifications
    # after an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
    # afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
    # no activity.

    # [Experimental] `rule_matching`
    #
    # The `rule_matching` configuration key's values are:
    #  - `first`: Falco stops checking conditions of rules against upcoming event
    #    at the first matching rule
    #  - `all`: Falco will continue checking conditions of rules even if a matching
    #    one was already found
    #
    # Rules conditions are evaluated in the order they are defined in the rules files.
    # For this reason, when using `first` as value, only the first defined rule will
    # trigger, possibly shadowing other rules.
    # In case `all` is used as value, rules still trigger in the order they were
    # defined.
    #
    # Effectively, with this setting, it is now possible to apply multiple rules that match
    # the same event type. This eliminates concerns about rule prioritization based on the

    # a performance penalty. We recommend carefully testing this alternative setting before
