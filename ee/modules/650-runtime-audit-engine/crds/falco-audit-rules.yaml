                  Describes the Falco rules that will be applied to monitor the cluster runtime.

                  These rules help detect threats at runtime by observing the behavior of your applications and containers.

                  Refer to [the Falco documentation](https://falco.org/docs/rules/) and [reference](https://falco.org/docs/reference/rules/) for more details.
