                        ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
                        users must create. This is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta.

                        ObjectMeta is embedded in `Machine.Spec`, `MachineDeployment.Template`, and `MachineSet.Template`,
                        which are not top-level Kubernetes objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases
                        and read-only fields, which end up in the generated CRD validation, having it as a subset simplifies
                        the API and some issues that can impact user experience.

                        During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054)
                        for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs,
                        specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be of type string: "null"`.
                        The investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version
                        when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package.

                        In more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta`
                        had validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time).
                        The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null`
                        which breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable.

                        In future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded
                        types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.
