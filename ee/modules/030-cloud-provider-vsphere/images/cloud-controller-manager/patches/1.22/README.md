## Patches

### 002-network-name-discovery-logic.patch

#### Kubernetes versions prior to 1.22
This patch adds InternalNetworkNames and  ExternalNetworkNames parameters to VirtualCenter configuration section. 
Both of them we use to explicitly define what networks are external/internal to properly provide IP Addresses in the status of Node objects.

#### Kubernetes versions starting from 1.22
This patch allows setting multiple values separated with a comma in InternalNetworkName and ExternalNetworkName parameters in Nodes configuration section.
Both of them we use to explicitly define what networks are external/internal to properly provide IP Addresses in the status of Node objects.

Based on [PR#524](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/pull/524).
