      - Direct
    description: |
      The way the connection is implemented;
          * The following inlet types are supported:
            * `ExternalIP` — when there are nodes with public IPs. It is used together with the `externalIP` parameter;
            * `LoadBalancer` — for all cloud providers and cloud-based placement strategies that support the provision of LoadBalancers;
            * `HostPort` — the port of the openvpn server will be available on the node where it is scheduled. The port can be configured in the `hostPort` parameter;
            * `Direct` — for non-standard cases. You need to create a service called `openvpn-external` in the `d8-openvpn` namespace. It will route traffic to the pod with the `app: openvpn` label to the port called `ovpn-tcp` (or just 1194). This service provides the externalIP, the IP address of the balancer or its host. If none of these are present, you need to specify the `externalHost` parameter;
  loadBalancer:
    type: object
    description: |
      A section of optional parameters of the `LoadBalancer` inlet.

    properties:
      annotations:
        type: object
        description: |
          Annotations to assign to the service for flexible configuration of the load balancer;
              * **Note** that module does not take into account the specifics of setting annotations in different clouds. If annotations for the provision of the load balancer are only used when the service is being created, then you need to restart the module (disable/enable it) to update them;

        description: |
          The HTTPS usage mode:
              * `Disabled` — in this mode, the openvpn admin panel works over http only;

              * `CustomCertificate` — the openvpn admin panel will use the certificate from the `d8-system` namespace for HTTPS;
              * `OnlyInURI` — the openvpn admin panel will work over HTTP (thinking that there is an external HTTPS load balancer in front of it that terminates HTTPS traffic). All the links in the `user-authn` will be generated using the HTTPS scheme;
