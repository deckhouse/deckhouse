            Current release status.

            Typical values:

            - `Pending`: The release has been created but not applied yet (waiting for manual approval, update windows, canary release, or the minimal notification time).
            - `Deployed`: DKP has switched to the release version (module and component updates may continue asynchronously).
            - `Superseded`: The release is outdated and no longer used.
            - `Suspended`: The release has been canceled (typically before it was applied).
            - `Skipped`: The release was skipped because the requirements were not satisfied.
            
            For more information about DKP release statuses, refer to the [`deckhouse` module documentation](/modules/deckhouse/#deckhouse-releases-update).
