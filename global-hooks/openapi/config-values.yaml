  storageClass:
    type: string
    default: null
    description: |
      The storage class to use with all service components (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenVPN, ...).
        * By default, it is set to null. In this case, service components use `cluster.defaultStorageClass`
          (which is determined automatically) or `emptyDir` (if `cluster.defaultStorageClass` isn't defined).
        * Use this parameter only in exceptional circumstances.
  highAvailability:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A global switch to enable the HA mode for modules that support it.

      The parameter is not defined by default; the decision is made based on the `global.discovery.clusterControlPlaneIsHighlyAvailable` parameter.

        type: string
        default: nginx
        description: |
          The class of the Ingress controller used for service components.
      publicDomainTemplate:
        type: string
        # only check that is containing %s
        pattern: '.*%s.*'
        description: |
          The template with the `%s` key as the dynamic string parameter.

          Deckhouse will use this template for creating DNS records.
          The latter are necessary for the internal needs of Deckhouse and the operation of the modules.

          **Do not use** DNS names (nor do create Ingress resources) that match this template to avoid conflicts with the Ingress resources created by Deckhouse.

          If this parameter is omitted, no Ingress resources will be created.

              The HTTPS usage mode:

              * `CertManager` — all service components use HTTPS and get a certificate from the ClusterIssuer defined in the `certManager.clusterIssuerName` parameter;
              * `CustomCertificate` — all service components use HTTPS using the certificate from the `d8-system` namespace;
              * `OnlyInURI` — all service components use HTTP (in the expectation that an HTTPS load balancer runs in front of them and terminates HTTPS).
