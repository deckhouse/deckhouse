## How to Migrate to the registry module?

During the migration, Containerd v1 will switch to the new registry configuration format.
Containerd v2 uses the new format by default. For more details, see the section [with a description of configuration methods](/modules/node-manager/latest/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry).

### For containerd v2

1. Switch to using the `registry` module. To do this, specify the `Unmanaged` mode parameters in the `deckhouse` `moduleConfig`. If you are using a registry other than `registry.deckhouse.io`, refer to the [`deckhouse`](/modules/deckhouse/latest/configuration.html) module documentation for proper configuration.

   You can view the current registry settings using the following command:

   ```bash
   d8 k -n d8-system exec -it svc/deckhouse-leader -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller global values | yq e '.modulesImages.registry' -
   ```

   Specify this configuration when setting up the `Unmanaged` mode:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     settings:
       registry:
         mode: Unmanaged
         unmanaged:
           imagesRepo: registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee
           scheme: HTTPS
           license: <LICENSE_KEY> # Replace with your license key
   ```

1. Wait for the switch to complete. Example [status output](./faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status):

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
     - lastTransitionTime: "..."
       message: ""
       reason: ""
       status: "True"
       type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

### For Containerd v1

{% alert level="danger" %}
- During the switch, containerd v1 will be restarted.
- During the switch, containerd v1 will be migrated to the new registry configuration scheme.
- During the switch, [custom registry configurations](/modules/node-manager/latest/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) for containerd v1 will be temporarily unavailable.
{% endalert %}

1. Make sure that nodes with containerd v1 do not have any [custom registry configurations](/modules/node-manager/latest/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) located in the `/etc/containerd/conf.d` directory.

1. If configurations are present, you need to migrate to the new registry configuration format in containerd. To do this, add new configuration files to the `/etc/containerd/registry.d` directory. These configurations will take effect after switching to the `registry` module. To add configurations, prepare a `NodeGroupConfiguration`. For more details, see the section [with a description of configuration methods](/modules/node-manager/latest/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry). Example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: NodeGroupConfiguration
   metadata:
     name: containerd-additional-config-auth.sh
   spec:
     # The step can be arbitrary, as restarting the containerd service is not required
     weight: 0
     bundles:
       - '*'
     nodeGroups:
       - "*"

       REGISTRY_URL=private.registry.example

       mkdir -p "/etc/containerd/registry.d/${REGISTRY_URL}"
       bb-sync-file "/etc/containerd/registry.d/${REGISTRY_URL}/hosts.toml" - << EOF
       [host]
         [host."https://${REGISTRY_URL}"]
           capabilities = ["pull", "resolve"]
           [host."https://${REGISTRY_URL}".auth]
             username = "username"
             password = "password"
       EOF
   ```

1. Apply the `NodeGroupConfiguration`. Wait until the configuration files appear in the `/etc/containerd/registry.d` directory on all nodes.

1. Verify that the configurations are working correctly. To do this, use the following command:

   ```bash
   # For HTTPS:
   ctr -n k8s.io images pull --hosts-dir=/etc/containerd/registry.d/ private.registry.example/registry/path:tag

   # For HTTP:
   ctr -n k8s.io images pull --hosts-dir=/etc/containerd/registry.d/ --plain-http private.registry.example/registry/path:tag
   ```

1. Switch to using the `registry` module. To do this, specify the `Unmanaged` mode parameters in the `deckhouse` `moduleConfig`. If you are using a registry other than `registry.deckhouse.io`, refer to the [`deckhouse`](/modules/deckhouse/latest/configuration.html) module documentation for proper configuration.

   You can view the current registry settings using the following command:

   ```bash
   d8 k -n d8-system exec -it svc/deckhouse-leader -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller global values | yq e '.modulesImages.registry' -
   ```

   Specify this configuration when setting up the `Unmanaged` mode:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     settings:
       registry:
         mode: Unmanaged
         unmanaged:
           imagesRepo: registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee
           scheme: HTTPS
           license: <LICENSE_KEY> # Replace with your license key
   ```

1. After applying, wait for the following message to appear in the [switch status](faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status):

   Example output:

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "2025-08-13T15:22:34Z"
     message: |
       Check current nodes configuration
       2/2 node(s) Unready:
       - master-0: has custom toml merge containerd configuration
       - worker-5e389be0-578df-s5sm5: has custom toml merge containerd configuration
     reason: Processing
     status: "False"
     type: ContainerdConfigPreflightReady
   ```

   This message means that there are old registry configurations on the nodes located in the `/etc/containerd/conf.d` directory. The switch to the new containerd configuration is currently blocked. To allow the switch, you need to remove the old configuration files.

1. Remove the old configuration files to allow switching to the `registry` module. To do this, create a `NodeGroupConfiguration`, for example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: NodeGroupConfiguration
   metadata:
     name: containerd-additional-config-auth.sh
   spec:
     # To add a file before the '032_configure_containerd.sh' step
     weight: 0
     bundles:
       - '*'
     nodeGroups:
       - "*"

       file="/etc/containerd/conf.d/old-config.toml"

       [ -f "$file" ] && rm -f "$file"
   ```

1. After removing the old configurations, make sure that the switch has resumed. Example of the [switch status](faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status):

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "2025-08-13T16:42:09Z"
     message: ""
     reason: ""
     status: "True"
     type: ContainerdConfigPreflightReady
   ```

1. Wait for the switch to complete. Example of the [switch status](faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status):

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
     - lastTransitionTime: "..."
       message: ""
       reason: ""
       status: "True"
       type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

## How to Migrate Back from the Registry Module?

{% alert level="danger" %}
- This is a deprecated registry management format.
- During the switch, containerd v1 will be restarted.
- During the switch, containerd v1 will be migrated to the legacy registry configuration scheme.
- During the switch, [custom registry configurations](/modules/node-manager/latest/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) for containerd v1 will be temporarily unavailable.
{% endalert %}

1. Switch the registry to `Unmanaged` mode. If you are using a registry other than `registry.deckhouse.io`, refer to the [`deckhouse`](/modules/deckhouse/latest/configuration.html) module documentation for proper configuration.

   Example configuration:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     settings:
       registry:
         mode: Unmanaged
         unmanaged:
           imagesRepo: registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee
           scheme: HTTPS
           license: <LICENSE_KEY>
   ```

1. Check the switch status using the [instruction](./faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status). Example output:

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "..."
     message: ""
     reason: ""
     status: "True"
     type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

1. Switch the registry to the non-configurable `Unmanaged` mode. Example configuration:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     settings:
       registry:
         mode: Unmanaged
   ```

1. Check the switch status using the [instruction](./faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status). Example output:

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "..."
     message: ""
     reason: ""
     status: "True"
     type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

1. If containerd v1 is used and [custom registry configurations](/modules/node-manager/latest/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) are applied in the cluster, they must be replaced with the old format. To do this, prepare the registry configurations in the old format. These configurations do not need to be applied at this stage. Example configuration:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: NodeGroupConfiguration
   metadata:
     name: containerd-additional-config-auth.sh
   spec:
     # To add a file before the '032_configure_containerd.sh' step
     weight: 31
     bundles:
       - '*'
     nodeGroups:
       - "*"

       REGISTRY_URL=private.registry.example

       mkdir -p /etc/containerd/conf.d
       bb-sync-file /etc/containerd/conf.d/additional_registry.toml - << EOF
       [plugins]
         [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
           [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry]
             [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors]
               [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors."${REGISTRY_URL}"]
                 endpoint = ["https://${REGISTRY_URL}"]
             [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs]
               [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs."${REGISTRY_URL}".auth]
                 username = "username"
                 password = "password"
                 # OR
                 auth = "dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
       EOF
   ```

1. Delete the `registry-bashible-config` secret. This will trigger containerd v1 to switch back to the legacy registry format:

   ```bash
   d8 k -n d8-system delete secret registry-bashible-config
   ```

1. After deletion, wait for the switch to complete. Use the [instruction](faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status) to track the progress. Example output:

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "..."
     message: ""
     reason: ""
     status: "True"
     type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

1. If containerd v1 is used, apply the previously prepared `NodeGroupConfiguration` with custom registry configurations.

1. Disable the `registry` module. Example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: registry
   spec:
     enabled: false
     settings: {}
     version: 1
   ```

## How to check the registry mode switch status?

The status of the registry mode switch can be retrieved using the following command:

<!-- TODO(nabokihms): replace with d8 subcommand when available -->
```bash
d8 k -n d8-system -o yaml get secret registry-state | yq -C -P '.data | del .state | map_values(@base64d) | .conditions = (.conditions | from_yaml)'
```

Example output:

```yaml
conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:52:46Z"
    message: 'registry.deckhouse.io: all 157 items are checked'
    reason: Ready
    status: "True"
    type: RegistryContainsRequiredImages
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-11T11:59:03Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: ContainerdConfigPreflightReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:47:47Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: TransitionContainerdConfigReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:52:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: InClusterProxyReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:54:53Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: DeckhouseRegistrySwitchReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:55:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: FinalContainerdConfigReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:55:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
mode: Direct
target_mode: Direct
```

The output displays the status of the switch process. Each condition can have a status of `True` or `False`, and may contain a `message` field with additional details.

Description of conditions:

| Condition                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ContainerdConfigPreflightReady`  | State of the containerd configuration preflight check. Verifies there are no custom containerd auth configurations on the nodes.                                             |
| `TransitionContainerdConfigReady` | State of preparing the containerd configuration for the new mode. Verifies that the configuration contains both the old and new mode settings.                               |
