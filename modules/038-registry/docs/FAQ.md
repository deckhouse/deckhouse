## How to Migrate to the Registry Module?

During the migration, Containerd v1 will switch to the new registry configuration format.
Containerd v2 uses the new format by default. See the ["Adding a custom registry configuration"](../node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) section for details.

### For Containerd v2

1. Switch to using the Registry module. To do this, specify the `Unmanaged` mode parameters in the `deckhouse` `moduleConfig`. If you are using a registry other than `registry.deckhouse.ru`, refer to the [deckhouse](../deckhouse/) module documentation for proper configuration.

   You can view the current registry settings using the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n d8-system exec -it svc/deckhouse-leader -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller global values | yq e '.modulesImages.registry' -
   ```

   Specify this configuration when setting up the `Unmanaged` mode:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     settings:
       registry:
         mode: Unmanaged
         unmanaged:
           imagesRepo: registry.deckhouse.ru/deckhouse/ee
           scheme: HTTPS
           license: <LICENSE_KEY> # Replace with your license key
   ```

1. Wait for the switch to complete. Example [status output](./faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status):

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
     - lastTransitionTime: "..."
       message: ""
       reason: ""
       status: "True"
       type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

### For Containerd v1

{% alert level="danger" %}
- During the switch, containerd v1 will be restarted.
- During the switch, containerd v1 will be migrated to the new registry configuration scheme.
- During the switch, [custom registry configurations](../node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) for containerd v1 will be temporarily unavailable.
{% endalert %}

1. Make sure that nodes with containerd v1 do not have any [custom registry configurations](../node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) located in the `/etc/containerd/conf.d` directory.

1. If configurations are present, you need to migrate to the new registry configuration format in containerd. To do this, add new configuration files to the `/etc/containerd/registry.d` directory. These configurations will take effect after switching to the registry module. To add configurations, prepare a `NodeGroupConfiguration`. See more details in the section ["adding custom registry configuration"](../node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry). Example:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
  kind: NodeGroupConfiguration
  metadata:
    name: containerd-additional-config-auth.sh
  spec:
    # Шаг может быть любой, т.к. не требуется перезапуск сервиса containerd
    weight: 0
    bundles:
      - '*'
    nodeGroups:
      - "*"

      REGISTRY_URL=private.registry.example

      mkdir -p "/etc/containerd/registry.d/${REGISTRY_URL}"
      bb-sync-file "/etc/containerd/registry.d/${REGISTRY_URL}/hosts.toml" - << EOF
      [host]
        [host."https://${REGISTRY_URL}"]
          capabilities = ["pull", "resolve"]
          [host."https://${REGISTRY_URL}".auth]
            username = "username"
            password = "password"
      EOF
  ```

1. Apply the `NodeGroupConfiguration`. Wait until the configuration files appear in the `/etc/containerd/registry.d` directory on all nodes.

1. Verify that the configurations are working correctly. To do this, use the following command:

   ```bash
   # For HTTPS:
   ctr -n k8s.io images pull --hosts-dir=/etc/containerd/registry.d/ private.registry.example/registry/path:tag

   # For HTTP:
   ctr -n k8s.io images pull --hosts-dir=/etc/containerd/registry.d/ --plain-http private.registry.example/registry/path:tag
   ```

1. Switch to using the Registry module. To do this, specify the `Unmanaged` mode parameters in the `deckhouse` `moduleConfig`. If you are using a registry other than `registry.deckhouse.ru`, refer to the [deckhouse](../deckhouse/) module documentation for proper configuration.

   You can view the current registry settings using the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n d8-system exec -it svc/deckhouse-leader -c deckhouse -- deckhouse-controller global values | yq e '.modulesImages.registry' -
   ```

   Specify this configuration when setting up the `Unmanaged` mode:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     settings:
       registry:
         mode: Unmanaged
         unmanaged:
           imagesRepo: registry.deckhouse.ru/deckhouse/ee
           scheme: HTTPS
           license: <LICENSE_KEY> # Replace with your license key
   ```

1. After applying, wait for the following message to appear in the [switch status](faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status):

   Example output:

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "2025-08-13T15:22:34Z"
     message: |
       Check current nodes configuration
       2/2 node(s) Unready:
       - master-0: has custom toml merge containerd configuration
       - worker-5e389be0-578df-s5sm5: has custom toml merge containerd configuration
     reason: Processing
     status: "False"
     type: ContainerdConfigPreflightReady
   ```

   This message means that there are old registry configurations on the nodes located in the `/etc/containerd/conf.d` directory. The switch to the new containerd configuration is currently blocked. To allow the switch, you need to remove the old configuration files.

1. Remove the old configuration files to allow switching to the registry module. To do this, create a `NodeGroupConfiguration`, for example:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
  kind: NodeGroupConfiguration
  metadata:
    name: containerd-additional-config-auth.sh
  spec:
    # Шаг должен выполниться до '032_configure_containerd.sh'
    weight: 0
    bundles:
      - '*'
    nodeGroups:
      - "*"
    content: |
      # Copyright 2023 Flant JSC

      file="/etc/containerd/conf.d/old-config.toml"

      [ -f "$file" ] && rm -f "$file"
  ```

1. After removing the old configurations, make sure that the switch has resumed. Example of the [switch status](faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status):

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "2025-08-13T16:42:09Z"
     message: ""
     reason: ""
     status: "True"
     type: ContainerdConfigPreflightReady
   ```

1. Wait for the switch to complete. Example of the [switch status](faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status):

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
     - lastTransitionTime: "..."
       message: ""
       reason: ""
       status: "True"
       type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

## How to Migrate Back from the Registry Module?

{% alert level="danger" %}
- This is a deprecated registry management format.
- During the switch, containerd v1 will be restarted.
- During the switch, containerd v1 will be migrated to the legacy registry configuration scheme.
- During the switch, [custom registry configurations](../node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) for containerd v1 will be temporarily unavailable.
{% endalert %}

1. Switch the registry to `Unmanaged` mode. If you are using a registry other than `registry.deckhouse.ru`, refer to the [deckhouse](../deckhouse/) module documentation for proper configuration.

   Example configuration:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     settings:
       registry:
         mode: Unmanaged
         unmanaged:
           imagesRepo: registry.deckhouse.ru/deckhouse/ee
           scheme: HTTPS
           license: <LICENSE_KEY>
   ```

1. Check the switch status using the [instruction](./faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status). Example output:

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "..."
     message: ""
     reason: ""
     status: "True"
     type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

1. Switch the registry to the non-configurable `Unmanaged` mode. Example configuration:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ModuleConfig
   metadata:
     name: deckhouse
   spec:
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     settings:
       registry:
         mode: Unmanaged
   ```

1. Check the switch status using the [instruction](./faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status). Example output:

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "..."
     message: ""
     reason: ""
     status: "True"
     type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

1. If containerd v1 is used and [custom registry configurations](../node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-configuration-for-an-additional-registry) are applied in the cluster, they must be replaced with the old format. To do this, prepare the registry configurations in the old format. These configurations do not need to be applied at this stage. Example configuration:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
  kind: NodeGroupConfiguration
  metadata:
    name: containerd-additional-config-auth.sh
  spec:
    # Для добавления файла перед шагом '032_configure_containerd.sh'
    weight: 31
    bundles:
      - '*'
    nodeGroups:
      - "*"
    content: |

      REGISTRY_URL=private.registry.example

      mkdir -p /etc/containerd/conf.d
      bb-sync-file /etc/containerd/conf.d/additional_registry.toml - << EOF
      [plugins]
        [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
          [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry]
            [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors]
              [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors."${REGISTRY_URL}"]
                endpoint = ["https://${REGISTRY_URL}"]
            [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs]
              [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs."${REGISTRY_URL}".auth]
                username = "username"
                password = "password"
                # OR
                auth = "dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
      EOF
  ```

1. Delete the `registry-bashible-config` secret. This will trigger containerd v1 to switch back to the legacy registry format:

   ```bash
   d8 k -n d8-system delete secret registry-bashible-config
   ```

1. After deletion, wait for the switch to complete. Use the [instruction](faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status) to track the progress. Example output:

   ```yaml
   conditions:
   # ...
   - lastTransitionTime: "..."
     message: ""
     reason: ""
     status: "True"
     type: Ready
   hash: ..
   mode: Unmanaged
   target_mode: Unmanaged
   ```

1. If containerd v1 is used, apply the previously prepared `NodeGroupConfiguration` with custom registry configurations.

1. Disable the registry module. Example:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ModuleConfig
  metadata:
    name: registry
  spec:
    enabled: false
    settings: {}
    version: 1
  ```

## How to check the registry mode switch status?

The status of the registry mode switch can be retrieved using the following command:

<!-- TODO(nabokihms): replace with d8 subcommand when available -->
```bash
d8 k -n d8-system -o yaml get secret registry-state | yq -C -P '.data | del .state | map_values(@base64d) | .conditions = (.conditions | from_yaml)'
```

Example output:

```yaml
conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:52:46Z"
    message: 'registry.deckhouse.ru: all 157 items are checked'
    reason: Ready
    status: "True"
    type: RegistryContainsRequiredImages
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-11T11:59:03Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: ContainerdConfigPreflightReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:47:47Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: TransitionContainerdConfigReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:52:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: InClusterProxyReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:54:53Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: DeckhouseRegistrySwitchReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:55:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: FinalContainerdConfigReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:55:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
mode: Direct
target_mode: Direct
```

The output displays the status of the switch process. Each condition can have a status of `True` or `False`, and may contain a `message` field with additional details.

Description of conditions:

| Condition                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ContainerdConfigPreflightReady`  | State of the containerd configuration preflight check. Verifies there are no custom containerd auth configurations on the nodes.                                             |
| `TransitionContainerdConfigReady` | State of preparing the containerd configuration for the new mode. Verifies that the configuration contains both the old and new mode settings.                               |
| `FinalContainerdConfigReady`      | State of finalizing the switch to the new containerd mode. Verifies that the containerd configuration has been successfully applied and contains only the new mode settings. |
| `DeckhouseRegistrySwitchReady`    | State of switching Deckhouse and its components to use the new registry. `True` means Deckhouse successfully switched and is ready to operate.                               |
| `InClusterProxyReady`             | State of In-Cluster Proxy readiness. Checks that the In-Cluster Proxy has started successfully and is running.                                                               |
| `CleanupInClusterProxy`           | State of cleaning up the In-Cluster Proxy if it is not needed in the selected mode. Verifies that all related resources have been removed.                                   |
| `Ready`                           | Overall state of registry readiness in the selected mode. Indicates that all other conditions are met and the module is ready to operate.                                    |
