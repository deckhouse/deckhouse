## How to prepare Containerd V1?

When switching to the `Direct` mode, the `Containerd V1` service will be restarted.  
The authorization configuration will be switched to Mirror Auth (this configuration is used by default in `Containerd V2`).  
After switching back to `Unmanaged`, the updated authorization configuration will remain unchanged.

Example directory structure for Mirror Auth configuration:

```bash
tree /etc/containerd/registry.d
.
├── registry.d8-system.svc:5001
│   ├── ca.crt
│   └── hosts.toml
└── registry.deckhouse.ru
    ├── ca.crt
    └── hosts.toml
```

Example hosts.toml configuration:

```
[host]
  [host."https://registry.deckhouse.ru"]
    capabilities = ["pull", "resolve"]
    skip_verify = true
    ca = ["/path/to/ca.crt"]
    [host."https://registry.deckhouse.ru".auth]
      username = "username"
      password = "password"
      # If providing auth string:
      auth = "<base64>"
```

Before switching, make sure there are no  
[custom authorization configurations](/products/kubernetes-platform/documentation/v1/modules/node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-additional-registry-auth)  
present on nodes with `Containerd V1` in the `/etc/containerd/conf.d` directory.

If such configurations exist:

{% alert level="danger" %}
- After deleting [custom authorization configurations](/products/kubernetes-platform/documentation/v1/modules/node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-additional-registry-auth) from the `/etc/containerd/conf.d` directory, the containerd service will be restarted. The removed configurations will no longer work.
- New Mirror Auth configurations added to `/etc/containerd/registry.d` will only take effect after switching to `Direct` mode.
{% endalert %}

1. Create new Mirror Auth configurations in the `/etc/containerd/registry.d` directory. Example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
    kind: NodeGroupConfiguration
    metadata:
      name: custom-registry
    spec:
      bundles:
        - '*'
      content: |
        #!/bin/bash
        REGISTRY_ADDRESS="registry.io"
        REGISTRY_SCHEME="https"
        host_toml=$(cat <<EOF
        [host]
          [host."https://registry.deckhouse.ru"]
            capabilities = ["pull", "resolve"]
            skip_verify = true
            ca = ["/path/to/ca.crt"]
            [host."https://registry.deckhouse.ru".auth]
              username = "username"
              password = "password"
              # If providing auth string:
              auth = "<base64>"
        EOF
        )
        mkdir -p "/etc/containerd/registry.d/${REGISTRY_ADDRESS}"
        echo "$host_toml" > "/etc/containerd/registry.d/${REGISTRY_ADDRESS}/hosts.toml"
      nodeGroups:
        - '*'
      weight: 0
    ```

    To test the configuration:

    ```bash
    # HTTPS:
    ctr -n k8s.io images pull --hosts-dir=/etc/containerd/registry.d/ registry.io/registry/path:tag

    # HTTP:
    ctr -n k8s.io images pull --hosts-dir=/etc/containerd/registry.d/ --plain-http registry.io/registry/path:tag
    ```

2. Delete auth configurations from the `/etc/containerd/conf.d` directory.

## How to switch back to the previous Containerd V1 auth configuration?

{% alert level="danger" %}
- This switch is only possible from the `Unmanaged` mode.
- When switching to the legacy `Containerd V1` auth configuration, any custom configurations in `/etc/containerd/registry.d` will stop working.
- [Custom auth configurations](/products/kubernetes-platform/documentation/v1/modules/node-manager/faq.html#how-to-add-additional-registry-auth) for the legacy auth format (using `/etc/containerd/conf.d`) can only be applied after switching to the legacy mode.
{% endalert %}

1. Switch the registry mode to `Unmanaged`.
2. Check the switching status using [this guide](./faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status). Example output:

    ```yaml
    ...
    - lastTransitionTime: "..."
      message: ""
      reason: ""
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
    hash: ..
    mode: Unmanaged
    target_mode: Unmanaged
    ```

3. Delete the secret registry-bashible-config:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n d8-system delete secret registry-bashible-config
    ```

4. After deleting the secret, wait for the auth configuration to switch back to the legacy one in `Containerd V1`.  
   You can use [this guide](./faq.html#how-to-check-the-registry-mode-switch-status) to track the switch. Example output:

    ```yaml
    ...
    - lastTransitionTime: "..."
      message: ""
      reason: ""
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
    hash: ..
    mode: Unmanaged
    target_mode: Unmanaged
    ```

## How to check the registry mode switch status?

The status of the registry mode switch can be retrieved using the following command:

<!-- TODO(nabokihms): replace with d8 subcommand when available -->
```bash
kubectl -n d8-system -o yaml get secret registry-state | yq -C -P '.data | del .state | map_values(@base64d) | .conditions = (.conditions | from_yaml)'
```

Example output:

```yaml
conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:52:46Z"
    message: 'registry.deckhouse.ru: all 157 items are checked'
    reason: Ready
    status: "True"
    type: RegistryContainsRequiredImages
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-11T11:59:03Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: ContainerdConfigPreflightReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:47:47Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: TransitionContainerdConfigReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:52:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: InClusterProxyReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:54:53Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: DeckhouseRegistrySwitchReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:55:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: FinalContainerdConfigReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-07-15T12:55:48Z"
    message: ""
    reason: ""
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
mode: Direct
target_mode: Direct
```

The output displays the status of the switch process. Each condition can have a status of `True` or `False`, and may contain a `message` field with additional details.

Description of conditions:

| Condition                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ContainerdConfigPreflightReady`  | State of the `containerd` configuration preflight check. Verifies there are no custom `containerd` auth configurations on the nodes.                                             |

| `InClusterProxyReady`             | State of In-Cluster Proxy readiness. Checks that the In-Cluster Proxy has started successfully and is running.                                                                   |
| `CleanupInClusterProxy`           | State of cleaning up the In-Cluster Proxy if it is not needed in the selected mode. Verifies that all related resources have been removed.                                       |
| `Ready`                           | Overall state of registry readiness in the selected mode. Indicates that all other conditions are met and the module is ready to operate.                                        |
