# Test fixture: CONNECT to pods/exec on heritage pod from d8-system SA
# Expected: ALLOWED (service accounts from d8-* namespaces are allowed)
#
# Note: gator v3.9.0 cannot simulate custom AdmissionReview fields.
# This fixture documents the expected behavior for manual testing.
#
# AdmissionReview context (simulated):
#   operation: CONNECT
#   resource.resource: pods/exec
#   namespace: d8-system
#   name: test-pod
#   userInfo.username: system:serviceaccount:d8-system:test-sa
