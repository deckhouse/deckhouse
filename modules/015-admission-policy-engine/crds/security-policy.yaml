                            Both formats are supported:
                            - Via annotations: `runtime/default`, `docker/default`, `unconfined`, `localhost/some-profile.json`.
                              `localhost/*` allows any local profile.
                            - Via securityContext: `RuntimeDefault`, `Unconfined`, `Localhost`.
                              For `Localhost`, specify the allowed profiles using the `allowedLocalhostFiles` parameter.

                            Profile types:
                            - `Unconfined` — no restrictions (not recommended for security reasons).
                            - `RuntimeDefault` — the default profile provided by the container runtime (e.g., Docker, CRI-O).
                            - `Localhost` — a custom profile defined on the host (flexible and tailored to the application).

                            Using `*` allows all profiles. It's not necessary to specify both formats — they are automatically mapped to each other.

For example, for the value `company.registry.com/*`, any container images from the repository `company.registry.com` will be checked with the specified keys and access parameters.

                              If it does not contain the `*` symbol, it is considered an absolute address for a container image. For example, for the value `company.registry.com/nginx`, only the nginx image from the repository `company.registry.com` will be checked with the specified keys and access parameters.
