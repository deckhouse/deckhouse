        summary: Admission-policy-engine module hasn't been bootstrapped for 10 minutes.
        description: |-
          The admission-policy-engine module couldn't bootstrap.
          
          Steps to troubleshoot:
          
          1. Verify that the module's components are up and running:
          
             ```bash
             kubectl get pods -n d8-admission-policy-engine
             ```
          
          2. Check logs for issues, such as missing constraint templates or incomplete CRD creation:
          
             ```bash
             kubectl logs -n d8-system -lapp=deckhouse --tail=1000 | grep admission-policy-engine
             ```
