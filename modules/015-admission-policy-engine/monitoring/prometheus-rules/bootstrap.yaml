        summary: Admission policy engine module hasn't been bootstrapped for 10 minutes.
        description: |-
          Admission policy engine module couldn't bootstrap. Please check that the module's components are up and running: `kubectl get pods -n d8-admission-policy-engine`.
          Also, it makes sense to check relevant logs in case there are missing constraint
          templates or not all CRD were created: `kubectl  logs -n d8-system -lapp=deckhouse --tail=1000 | grep admission-policy-engine`
