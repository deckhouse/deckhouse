        description: |-
          You have configured [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/), and one or more running pods are violating these standards.

          To identify violating pods:

          - Run the following Prometheus query:
          
            ```promql
            count by (violating_namespace, violating_name, violation_msg) (
              d8_gatekeeper_exporter_constraint_violations{
                violation_enforcement="deny",
                violating_namespace=~".*",
                violating_kind="Pod",
                source_type="PSS"
              }
            )
            ```

          - Alternatively, check the admission-policy-engine Grafana dashboard.

          You have configured operation policies for the cluster, and one or more existing objects are violating these policies.

          To identify violating objects:

          - Run the following Prometheus query:

            ```promql
            count by (violating_namespace, violating_kind, violating_name, violation_msg) (
