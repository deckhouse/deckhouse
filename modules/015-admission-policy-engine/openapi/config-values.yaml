          The enforcement action to control what to do with the result of the constraint.
          - Deny — Deny action.
          - Dryrun — No action. It is used when debugging. Information about the event can be viewed in Grafana or in the console via kubectl.
          - Warn — Same as `Dryrun`. In addition to the event information, it provides some info on why that constraint would have been denied if you had set `Deny` instead of `Warn`.
