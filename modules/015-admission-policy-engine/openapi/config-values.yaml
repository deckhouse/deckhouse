          Enforcement action which will control what to do with the result of a constraint.
          - Deny — Deny action.
          - Dryrun — No action. It is used when debugging. Information about the event can be viewed in Grafana or in console with kubectl.
          - Warn — Same as `Dryrun`, but in addition to the event information there will be information about why that constraint would have been denied if you set `Deny` instead of `Warn`.

          - Warn
