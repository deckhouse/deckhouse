          Sets the default [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) policy for all **non-system** namespaces:
          - `Privileged` — an unrestricted policy. Privilege escalation is possible with this policy;
          - `Baseline` — a policy with minimum restrictions that prevents privilege escalation;
          - `Restricted` — a policy with maximum restrictions that conforms to current best practices for securely running applications in a cluster.
        enum:
          - Privileged
          - Baseline
          - Restricted

        description: |
          The enforcement action to control what to do with the result of the constraint.
          - Deny — Deny action.
          - Dryrun — No action. It is used when debugging. Information about the event can be viewed in Grafana or in the console via kubectl.
          - Warn — Same as `Dryrun`. In addition to the event information, it provides some info on why that constraint would have been denied if you had set `Deny` instead of `Warn`.
        enum:
          - Warn
          - Deny
          - Dryrun
