title: "The priority-class module: configuration"
---

This module is enabled by **default**.

The Pod specification must contain the
appropriate [priorityClassName](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#pod-priority)
.
It is essential to set the `priorityClassName` correctly. If in doubt, get your colleagues to help you.

> Any `priorityClassName` set to a Pod cannot lower its priority because the scheduler considers Pods without
> the `priority-class` as having the lowest (`develop`) priority.

Below is the list of priority classes set by the module (sorted by the priority, starting with the higher one).
**Caution!** Note that you cannot use the following PriorityClasses: `system-node-critical`, `system-cluster-critical`
, `cluster-medium`, `cluster-low`.
