# Kubernetes Cluster API Provider Static (CAPS)

Cluster API Provider Static is a Cluster API infrastructure provider that allows you to manage static nodes.

This provider allows operators to adopt Cluster API for deploying and managing kubernetes nodes without also having to adopt a specific infrastructure service. This enables users to decouple kubernetes node provisioning from host and infrastructure provisioning.
