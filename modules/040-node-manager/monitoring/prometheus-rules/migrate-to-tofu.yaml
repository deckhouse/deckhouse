      summary: Terraform state must be migrated to OpenTofu.
      description: |
        This likely means the automatic migration to OpenTofu was canceled due to destructive changes detected in the cluster state.

        Verify the following:

        - Current Terraform version:

          ```shell
          d8 k -n d8-system exec -it deployments/terraform-state-exporter -c exporter -- terraform version
          ```

        - Version in the Terraform state:

          ```shell
          d8 k -n d8-system get secret d8-cluster-terraform-state -o json | jq -r '.data["cluster-tf-state.json"] | @base64d | fromjson | .terraform_version'
          ```

        - Check for destructive changes:

          ```shell
          d8 k exec -it deploy/terraform-state-exporter -n d8-system -- dhctl terraform check
          ```

        To resolve the issue and migrate to OpenTofu manually, follow these steps:

        1. Using the `install` container with the previous major Deckhouse release (for example, `1.69.X`, while the cluster is now on `1.70.X`), run:

           ```shell
           dhctl converge
           ```

           This should resolve all destructive changes in the cluster.

        2. After that, the `terraform-auto-converger` Pod should complete the migration automatically.

        If the automatic migration doesn't happen, use the `install` container with the current Deckhouse release and run the following command to enforce migration of the Terraform state to OpenTofu:

        ```shell
        dhctl converge-migration
        ```

        If this alert appears in a cluster created by Deckhouse Commander, it means the cluster has been updated to a new Deckhouse version without approving state changes (for example, destructive changes).

        To resolve this, follow these steps:

        1. In Deckhouse Commander, click **Delete manually** to temporarily remove the cluster from control.
        2. In the cluster, remove the `commander-agent` module using the following command:

           ```shell
           d8 k delete mc commander-agent
           ```

        3. Using the `install` container with the previous major Deckhouse release (for example, `1.69.X`, while the cluster is now on `1.70.X`), run the following command to resolve all destructive changes in the cluster:

           ```shell
           dhctl converge
           ```

        4. In Deckhouse Commander, click **Attach** to reattach the cluster.
