### 004-set-priorities-for-to-de-deleted-machines-and-clean-annotation.patch

Remove additional cordoning nodes from mcm cloud provider.

New autoscaler works with new version MCM witch select nodes for deleting from annotation `node.machine.sapcloud.io/trigger-deletion-by-mcm`
This annotation does not support by our MCM, and we should set deleting priority with annotation `machinepriority.machine.sapcloud.io`.
We set priority for machines and keep `node.machine.sapcloud.io/trigger-deletion-by-mcm` annotation for calculation replicas,
but we need to clean deleted machines from annotation in refresh function for keeping up to date annotation value to avoid
drizzling replicas count in machine deployment.

### 005-set-priority-for-to-de-deleted-machines.patch

Report all machine creation errors to Cluster Autoscaler, not only ResourceExhausted

Previously, generateInstanceStatus only reported ErrorInfo to the Cluster Autoscaler when a Machine failed with ResourceExhausted error code (quota/stockout).
All other creation failures (invalid image, wrong credentials, network errors, etc.) returned InstanceStatus without ErrorInfo, making them invisible to CA's error handling.
