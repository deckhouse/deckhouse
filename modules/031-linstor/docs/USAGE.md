title: "The linstor module: configuration examples"
---

We're working hard to make Deckhouse easy to use and don't want to overwhelm you with too much information. Therefore, we decided to provide you with a simple and familiar interface for configuring LINSTOR. Namely, all you need is to create LVM partitions with certain tags. Such partitions will be automatically added to LINSTOR and will be available for use as a StorageClass in Kubernetes.

This service is currently under active development. In the meantime, you can refer to [advanced configuration](advanced_usage.html).
