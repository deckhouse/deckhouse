                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                          provisioner.
                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                  Phase is a simple, high-level summary of where the ArgoCDExport is in its lifecycle.
                  There are five possible phase values:
                  Pending: The ArgoCDExport has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the required resources have not been created.
                  Running: All of the containers for the ArgoCDExport are still running, or in the process of starting or restarting.
                  Succeeded: All containers for the ArgoCDExport have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
                  Failed: At least one container has terminated in failure, either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system.
                  Unknown: For some reason the state of the ArgoCDExport could not be obtained.
