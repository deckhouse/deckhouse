        The `prometheus-operator` Pod is not available.

        The new `Prometheus`, `PrometheusRules`, `ServiceMonitor` settings cannot be applied in the cluster; however, all existing and configured components continue to operate correctly.
        This problem will not affect alerting or monitoring in the short term (a few days).

        The recommended course of action:
        1. Analyze the Deployment info: `kubectl -n d8-operator-prometheus describe deploy prometheus-operator`;
        2. Examine the status of the Pod and try to figure out why it is not running: `kubectl -n d8-operator-prometheus describe pod -l app=prometheus-operator`.
      summary: Prometheus is unable to scrape `prometheus-operator` metrics.
