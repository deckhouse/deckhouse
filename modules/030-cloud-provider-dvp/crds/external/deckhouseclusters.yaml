                      controlPlaneInitialized denotes when the control plane is functional enough to accept requests.
                      This information is usually used as a signal for starting all the provisioning operations that depends on
                      a functional API server, but do not require a full HA control plane to exists, like e.g. join worker Machines,
                      install core addons like CNI, CPI, CSI etc.
