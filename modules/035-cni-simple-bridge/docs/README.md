The module does not have any settings.

During the initial setup of a new cluster, if no other CNI is explicitly specified, the `cni-simple-bridge` will be used by default for the following cloud providers:
- [AWS](../../modules/cloud-provider-aws/)
- [Azure](../../modules/cloud-provider-azure/)
- [GCP](../../modules/cloud-provider-gcp/)
- [Yandex](../../modules/cloud-provider-yandex/)
