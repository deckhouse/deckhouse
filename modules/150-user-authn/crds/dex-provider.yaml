            With it, you can flexibly configure the integration of the account directory with Kubernetes.

            **Warning.** It is forbidden to use users and groups with the `system:` prefix. Authentication attempts by such users or members of such groups will be rejected, and a corresponding warning will appear in the `kube-apiserver` logs.
