## Patches

### 001-client-filters.patch

With this patch, Dex can authorize requests for specific `OAuth2Client`s based on username and user's groups.
We use it in Dex authenticators to make `allowedUsers` and `allowedGroups` option to work.

This problem is not solved in upstream, and our patch will not be accepted.

### 002-gitlab-refresh-context.patch

Refresh can be called only one. By propagating a context of the user request, refresh can accidentally canceled.

To avoid this, this patch makes refresh requests to declare and utilize their own contexts.

### 003-static-user-groups.patch

Adding group entity to kubernetes authentication.

### 004-2fa.patch

This patch adds support for two-factor authentication (2FA) in Dex.
It allows users to enable 2FA for their accounts, enhancing security by requiring a second form of verification during the login process.

### 005-password-policy.patch

This patch implements password strength requirements and rotation rules
for local user accounts. The following features are added:

1. Configurable minimum password strength (using complexity checks)
2. Password expiration and forced rotation
3. Password reuse prevention
4. Account lockout after failed attempts

### 006-fix-render-error.patch

This patch changes the Internal Error message to a human-readable 'Access Denied' when login with a local user is restricted by group or email.

### 007-provide-custom-CA-to-gitlab-connector.patch

This patch allows Gitlab connector to use custom CA for HTTPS connections.
