## Patches

### 001-client-filters.patch

With this patch, Dex can authorize requests for specific `OAuth2Client`s based on username and user's groups.
We use it in Dex authenticators to make `allowedUsers` and `allowedGroups` option to work.

This problem is not solved in upstream, and our patch will not be accepted.

### 002-gitlab-refresh-context.patch

Refresh can be called only one. By propagating a context of the user request, refresh can accidentally canceled.

To avoid this, this patch makes refresh requests to declare and utilize their own contexts.

### 003-static-user-groups.patch

Adding group entity to kubernetes authentication.

### 004-2fa.patch

This patch adds support for two-factor authentication (2FA) in Dex.
It allows users to enable 2FA for their accounts, enhancing security by requiring a second form of verification during the login process.

Upstream PR: https://github.com/dexidp/dex/pull/3712

### 005-password-policy.patch

This patch implements password strength requirements and rotation rules
for local user accounts. The following features are added:

1. Configurable minimum password strength (using complexity checks)
2. Password expiration and forced rotation
3. Password reuse prevention
4. Account lockout after failed attempts

### 006-fix-render-error.patch

This patch changes the Internal Error message to a human-readable 'Access Denied' when login with a local user is restricted by group or email.

### 007-ipv6-host.patch

In the latest go versions (1.25.2, 1.24.8) the bug was fixed, and without this patch Dex fails with an error

Upstream PR: https://github.com/dexidp/dex/pull/4363

### 007-reset-pass-feat-2fa-fix.patch

This patch implements logic with forced password change flag, which can be set externally by some controlller.
User will be forced to change his password after successfull login. 

Also fixes a 2FA bug where a userâ€™s local account could become broken if they had no TOTP keys configured and Dex had 2FA enabled (users were created before this feature turned active).
