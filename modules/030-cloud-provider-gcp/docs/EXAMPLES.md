## An example of the `GCPInstanceClass`custom resource

Below is a simple example of custom resource `GCPInstanceClass` configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1
kind: GCPInstanceClass
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  machineType: n1-standard-1
```

## Configuring security policies on nodes

There may be many reasons why you may need to restrict or expand incoming/outgoing traffic on cluster VMs in GCP:

* Allow VMs on a different subnet to connect to cluster nodes.
* Allow connecting to the ports of the static node so that the application can work.
* Restrict access to external resources or other VMs in the cloud for security reasons.

For all this, additional network tags should be used.

## Enabling additional network tags on static and master nodes

This parameter can be set either in an existing cluster or when creating one. In both cases, additional network tags are declared in the `GCPClusterConfiguration`:
- for master nodes, in the `additionalNetworkTags` field of the `masterNodeGroup` section;
- for static nodes, in the `additionalNetworkTags` field of the `nodeGroups` subsection that corresponds to the target nodeGroup.

The `additionalNetworkTags` field contains an array of strings with network tags names.

## Enabling additional network tags on ephemeral nodes

You have to set the `additionalNetworkTags` parameter for all [`GCPInstanceClass`](cr.html#gcpinstanceclass) that require additional network tags.
