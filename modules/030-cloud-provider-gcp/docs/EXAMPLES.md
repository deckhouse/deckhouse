## An example of the `GCPInstanceClass`custom resource

Below is a simple example of custom resource `GCPInstanceClass` configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1
kind: GCPInstanceClass
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  machineType: n1-standard-1
```

## Configuring security policies on nodes

For cluster virtual machines in GCP, you may need to limit or expand incoming and outgoing traffic for various reasons. Some of these may include:

- Allowing connections to cluster nodes from virtual machines from a different subnet.
- Allow connections to static node ports for application operation.
- Restricting access to external resources or other virtual machines in the cloud at the request of the security service.

For all this, additional network tags must be used.

## Enabling additional network tags on static and master nodes

This parameter can be set either in an existing cluster or when creating one. In both cases, additional network tags are declared in the `GCPClusterConfiguration`:

- for master nodes, in the `additionalNetworkTags` field of the `masterNodeGroup` section;
- for static nodes, in the `additionalNetworkTags` field of the `nodeGroups` subsection that corresponds to the target nodeGroup.

The `additionalNetworkTags` field contains an array of strings with network tags names.

## Enabling additional network tags on ephemeral nodes

You have to set the `additionalNetworkTags` parameter for all [`GCPInstanceClass`](cr.html#gcpinstanceclass) that require additional network tags.
