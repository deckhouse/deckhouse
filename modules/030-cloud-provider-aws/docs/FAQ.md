## How do I create a peering connection between VPCs?

Let's, for example, create a peering connection between two VPCs, vpc-a and vpc-b.

> **Caution!** IPv4 CIDR must be unique for each VPC.

To configure, follow these steps:

1. Switch to the region where vpc-a is running.
1. CLick `VPC` -> `VPC Peering Connections` -> `Create Peering Connection` and then configure a peering connection:
   * Name: `vpc-a-vpc-b`.
   * Fill in `Local` and `Another VPC` fields.
1. Switch to the region where vpc-b is running.
1. Click `VPC` -> `VPC Peering Connections`.
1. Select the newly created perring connection and click `Action "Accept Request"`.
1. Add routes to vpc-b's CIDR over a peering connection to the vpc-a's routing tables.
1. Add routes to vpc-a's CIDR over a peering connection to the vpc-b's routing tables.

## How do I create a cluster in a new VPC with access over an existing bastion host?

1. Bootstrap the base-infrastructure of the cluster:

   ```shell
   dhctl bootstrap-phase base-infra --config config
   ```

2. Set up a peering connection using the instructions [above](#how-do-i-create-a-peering-connection-between-vpcs).

3. Continue installing the cluster, enter `y` when asked about the Terraform cache:

   ```shell
   dhctl bootstrap --config config --ssh-...
   ```

## How do I create a cluster in a new VPC and set up bastion host to access the nodes?

1. Bootstrap the base-infrastructure of the cluster:

   ```shell
   dhctl bootstrap-phase base-infra --config config
   ```

2. Manually set up the bastion host in the subnet <prefix>-public-0.

3. Continue installing the cluster, enter `y` when asked about the Terraform cache:

   ```shell
   dhctl bootstrap --config config --ssh-...
   ```

## Configuring a bastion host

There are two possible cases:
* A bastion host already exists in an external VPC; in this case, you need to:
  1. Create a basic infrastructure of the cluster: `dhctl bootstrap-phase base-infra`;
  1. Set up peering connection between an external and a newly created VPC;
  1. Continue the installation by specifying the bastion host: `dhctl bootstrap --ssh-bastion...`
* A bastion host needs to be deployed to a newly created VPC; in this case, you need to:
  1. Create a basic infrastructure of the cluster: `dhctl bootstrap-phase base-infra`;
  1. Manually run a bastion in the <prefix>-public-0 subnet;
  1. Continue the installation by specifying the bastion host: `dhctl bootstrap --ssh-bastion...`

## Adding CloudStatic nodes to a cluster

To add a pre-created VM as a node to a cluster, follow these steps:

1. Attach a security group `<prefix>-node` to the virtual machine.
1. Attach the IAM role `<prefix>-node` to the virtual machine.
1. Add the following tags to the virtual machine (so that `cloud-controller-manager` can find virtual machines in the cloud):

   ```text
   "kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster_uuid>" = "shared"
   "kubernetes.io/cluster/<prefix>" = "shared"
   ```

   * You can find out the `cluster_uuid` using the command:

     ```shell
     kubectl -n kube-system get cm d8-cluster-uuid -o json | jq -r '.data."cluster-uuid"'
     ```

   * You can find out `prefix` using the command:

     ```shell
     kubectl -n kube-system get secret d8-cluster-configuration -o json | jq -r '.data."cluster-configuration.yaml"' \
       | base64 -d | grep prefix
     ```

## How to increase the size of a volume?

Set the new size in the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim resource, in the `spec.resources.requests.storage` parameter.

The operation is fully automatic and takes up to one minute. No further action is required.

The progress of the process can be observed in events using the command `kubectl describe pvc`.

> After modifying a volume, you must wait at least six hours and ensure that the volume is in the `in-use` or `available` state before you can modify the same volume. This is sometimes referred to as a cooldown period. You can find details in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/modify-volume-requirements.html).
