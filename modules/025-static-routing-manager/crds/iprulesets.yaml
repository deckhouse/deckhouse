                        The priority of the rule (the order of application depends on it).
                        When choosing a number, it is worth considering several nuances:
                        - All rules are sorted by node's linux network subsystem in order of priority (from lesser to greater) until a match is found.
                        - If the packet falls under some rule, and the corresponding action has been successfully performed, then the search for rules termitated.
                        - The default rule for searching the `main` routing table is 32766. In this case, if you specify a higher value, the rule will never be processed.

                        A set of package attributes.
                        If the package has the attributes described in the `selectors` section, then actions from the `actions` section will be applied to it.
