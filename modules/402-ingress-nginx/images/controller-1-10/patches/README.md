### 002-healthcheck.patch

After catching SIGTERM, ingress stops responding to the readiness probe.
The combination of this patch and the `EndpointSliceTerminatingCondition` feature gate for kube-proxy helps us avoid
traffic loss on rollout updates.
Update: for external load balancers it's advisable to get 5xx if a SIGTERM was sent to the controller, we control this logic by applying/checking `D8s-External-Check` http header.

Backport of the behavior of the later versions of ingress nginx controller.
The `sleep` is needed to gracefully shut down ingress controllers behind a cloud load balancer.

### 003-nginx-tmpl.patch

* Enable our metrics collector instead of the default one.
* Enable pcre_jit.
* Add the health check server to provide the way for an external load balancer to check that the ingress controller will be terminated soon.
* Set default values for upstream_retries and total_upstream_response_time to avoid incorrect logs when it is a raw tcp request.
* Set proxy connect timeout for auth locations.
* Replace the status field with formatted status field which is explicitly converted to number to avoid incorrect logs when response status is 009.

We do not intend to make a PR to the upstream with these changes, because there are only our custom features.

### 004-lua-info.patch

There are two patches to fix the problem with ingress names in logs and metrics.
Unfortunately, the PR was declined in the upstream.

### 005-makefile.patch

Run the build locally, not inside the container.

### 006-metrics-SetSSLExpireTime.patch

Fixes namespace which is given by metric nginx_ingress_controller_ssl_expire_time_seconds.

https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/10274

### 007-auth-cookie-always.patch

Without always option toggled, ingress-nginx does not set the cookie in case if backend returns >=400 code, which may lead to dex refresh token invalidation.
Annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-always-set-cookie` does not work. Anyway, we can't use it, because we need this behavior for all ingresses.

### 008-util.patch

Adds "-e /dev/null" flags to the "nginx -t" invocations so that "nginx -t" logs aren't got saved to /var/log/nginx/error.log file, preventing fs bloating.

### 009-fix-cleanup.patch

Fix tmpDir path for the cleanup procedure.

https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/10797

### 010-nginx-build.patch

Build nginx for controller on ALT Linux.

### 011-add-http3.patch

Add HTTP/3 support.

We have made two PRs in upstream to bump ingress-nginx image and to enable http3 module. 
But we did not add full support for http3 in upstream, because at that time OpenSSL did not fully support quic.

Bump the image and enable http3 module: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/11470
README about next steps for upstream: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/11513

README: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/images/nginx/README.md

When OpenSSL fully supports quic, the work can be continued. 
To add fully support - steps from the readme should be accomplished and after this the patch can be deleted.

### 012-new-metrics.patch

This patch adds worker max connections, worker processes and worker max open files metrics.

### 013-default-backend-fix.patch

Fixes the problem with the controller when Ingress specifies `Service` with the `ExternalName` type as the main backend, and the default backend (using an annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/default-backend `) - with the ClusterIP type. You can see the detailed cases here:
