                    Attach annotations to the controller pods to automatically inject Istio sidecar containers.

                    After setting this parameter, the `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"` and `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: "<Service CIDR>"` annotations will be attached to the ingress-controller pods. During pod creation, the Istio's mutating webhook will add the sidecar to it. After that, the sidecar will catch the network traffic to Service CIDR.

                    To use this feature in your application, you must add these annotations to your Ingress resources:
                    * `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream: "true"` — using this annotation, the ingress-controller sends requests to a single ClusterIP (from Service CIDR) while envoy load balances them. Istio sidecar containers only catching traffic directed to Service CIDR.
                    * `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-vhost: myservice.myns.svc` — using this annotation, the sidecar can identify the application service that serves requests.

                    Regardless of the inlet type, the source IP address gets always verified (the `original_address` field in logs) (the address that the connection was established from) and not the "address of the client" that can be passed in some inlets via headers or using the proxy protocol.

                    This parameter is implemented using the [map module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_map_module.html). If the source address is not in the list of allowed addresses, nginx closes the connection immediately using HTTP code 444.

                    By default, the connection to the controller can be made from any address.

                    The way external traffic is routed to the cluster. Once you set the method, you cannot change it later.

                    Allowed values:

                    * `LoadBalancer`: The Ingress controller is deployed, and a `LoadBalancer`-type service is provisioned.
                    * `LoadBalancerWithProxyProtocol`: The Ingress controller is deployed, and a `LoadBalancer`-type service is provisioned. The Ingress controller uses the proxy-protocol to get a real IP address of the client.
                    * `LoadBalancerWithSSLPassthrough`: The Ingress controller is deployed, and a `LoadBalancer`-type service is provisioned. This option enables the SSL Passthrough feature, allowing backends to be configured to accept SSL traffic directly without termination at the Ingress controller.

                      > The SSL Passthrough feature is implemented by intercepting all traffic on the configured HTTPS port (default: `443`) and routing it to a local TCP proxy. This implementation bypasses nginx completely and introduces a significant performance penalty.

                      The SSL Passthrough protocol leverages Server Name Indication (SNI) and reads the virtual domain data from the TLS handshake protocol, which requires a compatible client.

                      If the host name doesn't match the requested host name, the request is forwarded to NGINX on the configured SSL Passthrough proxy port (default: `442`), which subsequently proxies the request to the default backend.

                      > Unlike HTTP backends, traffic to SSL Passthrough backends is routed to the ClusterIP of the backing service instead of individual endpoints.
                      >
                      > Since SSL Passthrough works at layer 4 of the OSI model (TCP) and not layer 7 (HTTP), using SSL Passthrough makes it impossible to use other annotations configured on an Ingress object.

                    * `HostPort`: The Ingress controller is deployed and made available on node ports via `hostPort`.
                    * `HostPortWithProxyProtocol`: The Ingress controller is deployed and made available on node ports via `hostPort`. The Ingress controller uses the proxy-protocol to get a real IP address of the client.

                      > **Caution.** When using this inlet, ensure that requests to the Ingress come from trusted sources only. To enforce it, use the `acceptRequestsFrom` parameter.

                    * `HostPortWithSSLPassthrough`: The Ingress controller is deployed and made available on node ports via `hostPort`. This option enables the SSL Passthrough feature, allowing backends to be configured to accept SSL traffic directly without termination at the Ingress controller.

                      Specify inlet parameters in the [`spec.HostPortWithSSLPassthrough`](#ingressnginxcontroller-v1-spec-hostportwithsslpassthrough) section.

                      The SSL Passthrough protocol leverages SNI and reads the virtual domain data from the TLS handshake protocol, which requires a compatible client.

                      If the host name doesn't match the requested host name, the request is forwarded to NGINX on the configured SSL Passthrough proxy port (default: `442`), which subsequently proxies the request to the default backend.

                    * `HostWithFailover`: Two Ingress controllers are deployed: a primary and a backup. The primary controller runs in a `hostNetwork`. If the primary controller pods are unavailable, traffic is routed to the backup controller.

When these pods are created, Istio sidecars will be automatically added to them via a mutating webhook. After that, the sidecar will intercept all traffic directed to the Service CIDR.

                    To use this feature, add the following annotations to your Ingress resources:

                    * `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream: "true"`: Using this annotation, the Ingress controller sends requests to a service ClusterIP (from Service CIDR) instead of sending them to the application pods. The `istio-proxy` sidecar only intercepts traffic directed to Service CIDR, while the remaining requests are sent directly.
                    * `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-vhost: myservice.myns.svc`: Using this annotation, the sidecar can identify the application service that serves requests.
