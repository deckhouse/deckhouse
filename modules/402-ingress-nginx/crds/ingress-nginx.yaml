                    The name of the Ingress class to use with the NGINX Ingress controller.

                    Using this option, you can create several controllers to use with a single ingress

                    **Caution!** If you set it to "nginx", then Ingress resources lacking the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation or `spec.ingressClassName` field will also be handled.

                    * `LoadBalancer` — Ingress controller is deployed and the service of `LoadBalancer` type is provisioned.
                    * `LoadBalancerWithProxyProtocol` — Ingress controller is deployed and the service of `LoadBalancer` type is provisioned. Ingress controller uses proxy-protocol to get a real IP of the client.
                    * `HostPort` — Ingress controller is deployed and available through nodes' ports via `hostPort`;

                      Settings are required in [spec.HostPort](#ingressnginxcontroller-v1-spec-hostport).
                    * `HostPortWithProxyProtocol` — Ingress controller is deployed and available through nodes' ports via `hostPort, it uses proxy-protocol to get a real IP of the client;

                      **Caution!** Make sure that requests to the Ingress are sent from trusted sources when using this inlet. The [acceptRequestsFrom](cr.html#ingressnginxcontroller-v1-spec-acceptrequestsfrom) parameter can help you with defining trusted sources.
                    * `HostWithFailover` — installs two ingress controllers, the primary and the backup one. The primary controller runs in a hostNetwork. If the pods of the primary controller are not available, the traffic is routed to the backup one;

                      **Caution!** There can be only one controller with this inlet type on a host.

                      **Caution!** The following ports must be available on the node: 80, 81, 443, 444, 10354, 10355.

                      **Caution!** To change inlet, remove the iptables rules and restart the `kube-proxy` pods or reboot the nodes hosting Ingress controllers.

                    After setting this parameter, the `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"` and `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: "<Service CIDR>"` annotations will be attached to the ingress-controller pods. During pod creation, the Istio's mutating webhook will add the sidecar to it. After that, the sidecar will catch the network traffic to Service CIDR.

                    To use this feature in your application, you must add these annotations to your Ingress resources:
                    * `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream: "true"` — using this annotation, the ingress-controller sends requests to a single ClusterIP (from Service CIDR) while envoy load balances them. Istio sidecar containers only catching traffic directed to Service CIDR.
                    * `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-vhost: myservice.myns.svc` — using this annotation, the sidecar can identify the application service that serves requests.

During pod creation, the Istio's mutating webhook will add the sidecar to it. After that, the sidecar will catch the network traffic to Service CIDR.

                    To use this feature in your application, you must add these annotations to your Ingress resources:
                    * `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream: "true"` — using this annotation, the ingress-controller sends requests to a single ClusterIP (from Service CIDR) while envoy load balances them. Istio sidecar containers only catching traffic directed to Service CIDR.
                    * `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-vhost: myservice.myns.svc` — using this annotation, the sidecar can identify the application service that serves requests.
