        summary: Nodes have unmet kernel requirements.
        description: |-
          Deckhouse has detected that some nodes don't meet the required kernel constraints.
          As a result, certain modules can't run on these nodes.

          Kernel requirements for each module:

          - **Cilium module**: Kernel version must be **>= 5.8**.

          To list all affected nodes, use the `d8_node_kernel_does_not_satisfy_requirements == 1` expression in Prometheus.
