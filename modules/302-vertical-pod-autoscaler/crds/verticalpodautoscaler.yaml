                  The resource policy may be used to set constraints on the recommendations

                  If any individual containers need to
                  be excluded from getting the VPA recommendations, then it must be

                  If not specified, the autoscaler computes recommended resources
                  for all containers in the pod, without additional constraints.

                  Points to the controller managing the set of

                  VerticalPodAutoscaler can be targeted at controller implementing
                  scale subresource (the pod set is retrieved from the controller's
                  `ScaleStatus`) or some well known controllers (e.g. for DaemonSet
                  the pod set is read from the controller's spec).

                  If VerticalPodAutoscaler
                  cannot use specified target it will report `ConfigUnsupported` condition.
                  Note that VerticalPodAutoscaler does not require full implementation
                  of scale subresource — it will not use it to modify the replica
                  count. The only thing retrieved is a label selector matching pods
                  grouped by the target resource.

                      - `Recreate` — this mode allows VPA to modify resource requirements of the running pods (i.e., restart them during operation). This mode might result in temporary unavailability of the service (due to restart) if you have just one replica (replicas: 1). In this mode, VPA does not recreate pods that were not created by a controller.
                      - `Initial` — VPA modifies pod resources only when pods are started (but not when pods are running).
                      - `Off` — VPA does not take any action to update the resource requests for the running containers. Autoscaler calculates recomendations and stores them in the status field of the VPA object. You can browse VPA recommendations using the following command: `d8 k describe vpa <vpa-name>`.
