/*

This migration converts episode timers to high precision â€” from seconds to nanoseconds, and renames the columns
accordingly. Also, tables are renamed to emphasis the entity of an episode, not just "downtime".

The precision of nanoseconds is chosen to conveniently convert the data to time.Duration.
