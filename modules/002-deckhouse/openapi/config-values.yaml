      The Deckhouse [bundle](../../#module-bundles) defines a set of modules enabled by default.
      - `Default` — the recommended set of modules for cluster operation: monitoring, authorization control, networking and other needs.
      - `Managed` — the bundle aimed at clusters managed by cloud providers (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine).
      - `Minimal` — the minimum possible bundle option (includes a single module — this one). **Note** that several basic modules are not included in the set of modules `Minimal` (for example, the CNI module). Deckhouse with the set of modules `Minimal` without the basic modules will be able to work only in an already deployed cluster.

            To change a minor version (for example, from `v1.69.*` to `v1.70.*`), confirmation is required.

            A patch version update (for example, from `v1.70.1` to `v1.70.2`) is applied taking into account the [update windows](#parameters-update-windows), if they are set.
          - `Auto` — automatic update mode for all versions.

            A minor version updates (for example, from `v1.69.*` to `v1.70.*`) and patch version updates (for example, from `v1.70.1` to `v1.70.2`) are applied taking into account the [update windows](#parameters-update-windows), if they are set.
          - `Manual` — manual update mode for all versions.

            Confirmation is required for updating both minor and patch versions.

          To confirm the version  update, it is necessary to set the `approved` field to `true` in the corresponding resource [DeckhouseRelease](../../cr.html#deckhouserelease).

              > **Caution!**
              > If you specify an invalid webhook address, Deckhouse update will be blocked.

              > Use the [minimalNotificationTime](#parameters-update-notification-minimalnotificationtime) parameter if necessary to set the minimum time that must pass before updating from the moment a new minor version appears on the release channel used.

              Description of POST request fields:
              - `subject` — string, the update event type. Possible values: `Deckhouse`, `Module`;
              - `moduleName` — string, the name of the module. Set only if `subject: Module`.

              The update mechanism ensures that Deckhouse will not be updated until a specified period of time has passed.

              When using update windows, the Deckhouse update will happen at the nearest possible update window but not before the time specified in `minimalNotificationTime` expires.
