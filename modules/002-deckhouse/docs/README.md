In Deckhouse, this module sets up:
- **[The logging level](configuration.html#parameters-loglevel)**;
- **[The set of modules](configuration.html#parameters-bundle) enabled by default**;

  Usually, the `Default` set is used (it is suitable for most cases).

  Regardless of the set of modules enabled by default, any module can be explicitly enabled or disabled in the Deckhouse configuration (learn more [about enabling and disabling a module](../../#enabling-and-disabling-the-module)).
- **[The release channel](configuration.html#parameters-releasechannel)**;

  Deckhouse has a built-in mechanism for automatic updates. This mechanism uses [5 release channels](../../deckhouse-release-channels.html) with various stability and frequency of releases. Learn more about [how the automatic update mechanism works](../../deckhouse-faq.html#how-does-automatic-deckhouse-update-work) and how you can [set the desired release channel](../../deckhouse-faq.html#how-do-i-set-the-desired-release-channel).
- **[The update mode](configuration.html#parameters-update-mode)** and **[update windows](configuration.html#parameters-update-windows)**;

  Deckhouse supports **manual** and **automatic** update modes.

  In the manual upgrade mode, only critical fixes (patch releases) are automatically applied, and upgrading to a more current Deckhouse release requires [manual confirmation](cr.html#deckhouserelease-v1alpha1-approved).

  In the automatic update mode, Deckhouse switches to a newer release as soon as it is available in the corresponding release channel unless [update windows](configuration.html#parameters-update-windows) are **configured** for the cluster. If update windows are **configured** for the cluster, Deckhouse will upgrade to a newer release during the next available update window.

- **Service for validating Custom Resources**.

  The validation service prevents creating Custom Resources with invalid values or adding such values to the existing Custom Resources. Note that it only tracks Custom Resources managed by Deckhouse modules.

### Deckhouse releases update

#### Get Deckhouse releases status

You can get Deckhouse releases list via the command `kubectl get deckhousereleases`. By default, a cluster keeps the last 10 outdated releases and all deployed/pending releases.

Every release can have one of the following statuses:
* `Pending` - release is waiting to be deployed: waiting for update window, canary deployment, etc. You can see the detailed status via the `kubectl describe deckhouserelease $name` command.
* `Deployed` - release is applied. It means that the Deckhouse image tag was changed, but the update process of all components
is going asynchronously and could not have been finished yet.
* `Outdated` - release is outdated and not used anymore.
* `Suspended` - release was suspended (for ex. it has an error). Can be set only if `suspended` release was not deployed yet.

#### Update process

When release status is changed to `Deployed` state, release is updating only a tag of the Deckhouse image.
Deckhouse will start checking and updating process of the all modules, which were changed from the last release.
Duration of an update could be different and connected to cluster size, enabled modules count and settings.
Foe example: if you cluster have a lot of `NodeGroup` resources, it will take some time to update them because these resources are updated one by one
`IngressNginxControllers` also updating one by one.

#### Manual release deployment

If you have a [manual update mode](usage.html#manual-update-confirmation) enabled and have a few Pending releases,
you can approve them all at once. In that case Deckhouse will update in series keeping a release order and changing their status during the update.

#### Pin a release

Release pinning could be necessary if you want to hold a Deckhouse update for some reason.

There are 3 options to pin a release:
- Set a [manual update mode](usage.html#manual-update-confirmation).

  In this case, you will hold a current release but patch-release will still be applied. Minor-release will not be changed without your approval.

  Example: The current release is `v1.29.3`, after setting a manual update mode Deckhouse will be able to update to version `v1.29.9` but won't be able to apply version `v1.30.0`.

- Set a specified image tag for deployment/deckhouse.

  In this case, you will hold a Deckhouse version until a new release will come. You may need this in a situation when some Deckhouse release has an error that hasn't occurred earlier and you want to roll back to the previous release but update as soon as a new release with a patch will come.

  Example:
  
  ```shell
  kubectl -n d8-system set image deployment/deckhouse deckhouse=registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee:v1.30.5
  ```

- Set a specified image tag for deployment/deckhouse and remove `releaseChannel` from deckhouse ConfigMap.

  In this case, you will hold a specified version and will not get any more updates.

  ```shell
  $ kubectl -n d8-system set image deployment/deckhouse deckhouse=registry.deckhouse.io/deckhouse/ee:v1.30.5
  $ kubectl -n d8-system edit cm deckhouse
    // remove releaseChannel
  ```
