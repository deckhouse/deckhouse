> **Note!** If the parameters provided below are changed, the **existing Machines are NOT redeployed** (new machines will be created with the updated parameters). Redeployment is only performed when `NodeGroup` and `YandexInstanceClass` are changed. Details in the [node-manager module's documentation](../../modules/040-node-manager/faq.html#how-do-i-redeploy-ephemeral-machines-in-the-cloud-with-a-new-configuration).

## Storage

The module automatically creates StorageClasses covering all available disks in Yandex:

| Type | StorageClass Name | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| network-hdd | network-hdd | |
| network-ssd | network-ssd | |
| network-ssd-nonreplicated | network-ssd-nonreplicated | |
| network-ssd-io-m3         | network-ssd-io-m3 | Disk size must be a multiple of 93 GB. |

You can filter out the unnecessary StorageClasses via the [exclude](#parameters-storageclass-exclude) parameter.

## LoadBalancer

The module subscribes to Service objects of the `LoadBalancer` type and creates the corresponding `NetworkLoadBalancer` and `TargetGroup` in Yandex Cloud.

For more information, see the [Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager for Yandex Cloud documentation](https://github.com/flant/yandex-cloud-controller-manager).
