          The name of StorageClass that will be used.

          If the parameter is omitted, the default StorageClass will be one of the following:
            
          * An arbitrary StorageClass present in the cluster that has the default annotation.
          * the first alphabetically ordered StorageClass created by the module.

          **Warning.** Specifying a value different from the one currently used (in the existing PVC) will result in disk re-provisioning and all data will be deleted.
          
          If `false` is specified, emptyDir will be forced to be used.
