        summary: StorageClass does not match the settings in ModuleConfig csi-nfs
        description: |
          It seems that the settings (spec.settings) of the ModuleConfig for csi-nfs have been changed, and now some StorageClass might fail to mount PV.
          You can find the list of problematic StorageClass using the following command:

          `kubectl get sc -l storage.deckhouse.io/does-not-match-moduleconfig="true"`

          It is necessary to revert the settings in the ModuleConfig for csi-nfs.
          If the StorageClass was configured with RPC-with-TLS support, make sure to specify the certificates that were previously used when reverting the settings.
          To edit the ModuleConfig, use the following command:

          `kubectl edit mc csi-nfs`
