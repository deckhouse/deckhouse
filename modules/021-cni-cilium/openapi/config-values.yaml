  labelsRegex:
    type: array
    description: |
      Cilium creates security identifiers based on the k8s entity labels. The more labels are involved in this process, the higher the access granularity that can be achieved.
      However, in large clusters, excessive granularity can create a heavy load. You can use the `labelsRegex` option to explicitly specify which labels are to be used for security policies,
      and which labels are to be neglected. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/operations/performance/scalability/identity-relevant-labels/#limiting-identity-relevant-labels) to learn more about reducing the identity cardinality

      Each label must be specified by a RegExp expression in YAML quoted string format. Note that special characters must be escaped.

  masqueradeMode:

    enum: ["Netfilter", "BPF"]
    default: "BPF"
    description: |
      Cilium masquerade work mode for pods traffic leaving the cluster.
      - `BPF` - use cilium BPF. Basic operation mode.

        In this mode, masquerade will not be used if the destination IP address is within the `podSubnetCIDR` or `InternalIP`/`ExternalIP` of any of the cluster nodes.

      - `Netfilter` - use kernel Netfilter(iptables/nf_tables).

        In this mode, masquerade will not be used if the destination IP address is within the `podSubnetCIDR` or `InternalIP`/`ExternalIP` of any of the cluster nodes.

      > In `BPF` mode, if `ExternalIP` other than `InternalIP` is specified for a cluster node, and that IP address is not currently assigned to any interface on the node, it will not be reachable from neighboring nodes from pods network.
      > The `Netfilter` mode allows you to bypass this limitation, but some other features stop working, such as `EgressGateway``.
  tunnelMode:

      Tunnel mode.

      > Note! After changing the parameter, it is necessary to restart all nodes, otherwise, there may be problems with the availability of Pods!

      > Note! VXLAN mode is not compatible with following bpfLBMode modes: Hybrid, DSR. bpfLBMode will be overriden to SNAT if the tunnelMode is VXLAN.
      
      > Note! When using the Disabled mode in a static cluster in Yandex Cloud, you need to set the `bpfLBMode` parameter to the `DSR` mode and create routes to the pod subnets through the nodes on which these subnets exist. You can view the node subnet using the command `kubectl get nodes NODE_NAME -o jsonpath='{.spec.podCIDRs}'`
  svcSourceRangeCheck:
    type: boolean

    description: |
      For services of the `loadBalancer` type, enables checking the source IP for compliance with [loadBalancer.sourceRanges](../ingress-nginx/cr.html#ingressnginxcontroller-v1-spec-loadbalancer-sourceranges).
      The check is not performed if access is made from within the cluster or the `sourceRanges` parameter is empty/not specified.
      Some cloud providers support filtering of incoming traffic based on the `sourceRanges` parameter in their loadBalancer implementations. In such cases, the [cilium documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/kubernetes/kubeproxy-free/#loadbalancer-source-ranges-checks)
      recommends disabling the `svcSourceRangeCheck` option.

      Do not enable if another balancer or any type of SNAT is running in front of the services.
  loadBalancerSourceRangeAllTypes:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: |

  exclusiveCNIPlugin:

    description: |
      Prevents additional CNI plugins from being enabled on cluster nodes. If the Istio module's [`dataPlane.trafficRedirectionSetupMode` setting](../istio/configuration.html#parameters-dataplane-trafficredirectionsetupmode) is set to `CNIPlugin`, the option will be automatically set to `false`.

      Explicitly disabling this option is recommended only when using an additional CNI or a specific CNI plugin in the cluster. An example of such a use case could be the Linkerd CNI plugin.
  bpfLBMode:
    type: string
    default: "Hybrid"
    enum: ["SNAT", "Hybrid", "DSR"]
    description: |
      eBPF LoadBalancer mode:
      - `SNAT` — traffic from the client to the pod (and back) passes through NAT, and accordingly the sender's address is lost.
      - `DSR` — traffic from the client to the pod passes with the sender's address preserved, and back - according to the routing rules (bypassing the balancer). This mode saves network traffic and reduces delays, but only works for TCP traffic.
      - `Hybrid` — TCP traffic is processed in DSR mode, and UDP traffic is processed in SNAT mode.
  activeL2NeighborDiscoveryEnabled:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: |
      Enables the Cilium `L2 neighbor discovery` mechanism, which helps ensure that ARP table entries are kept up-to-date on all cluster nodes.
  extraLoadBalancerAlgorithmsEnabled:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    x-experimental: true
    description: |
      Allows selectively overriding the load balancing algorithm using eBPF between backends for individual services. The annotation `service.cilium.io/lb-algorithm` is used for overriding with one of the following values: `random`, `maglev`, or `least-conn`.

      > Note! This option requires the Linux kernel version on the nodes to be at least 5.15.
