## 007-fix-restoring-cep-for-dead-local-endpoint.patch

Fixed bug when agent uses CiliumEndpoint cache for dead local endpoints.

## 008-hide-error-of-incompatibility-of-egw-with-ces.patch

In the PR <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/27984>, an error has been introduced if `CES` and `EGW` are enabled together, as some of the features are not functioning correctly.

While we were previously satisfied with the older behavior, the agent is now unable to start due to this error.

Please remove this change after `CES` becomes Stable. <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/31904#issuecomment-2647858564>

## 009-wireguard-port.patch

Changing the hardcoded wireguard port from `51871` to `4287` (a port within our range).

## 010-fix-cilium-local-redirect-policy.patch

When the `bpf-lb-algorithm-annotation` option is enabled, the `CiliumLocalRedirectPolicy` in Cilium version 1.17.4 stops working. This patch solves the problem with the way the LoadBalancerAlgorithm processes.

Upstream PR <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/40246>.

## 011-bpf-lb-use-random-lb-algo-for-hostport-serives-fixed.patch

## 012-add-least-conn-lb-algorithm.patch

Added an implementation of the Least Connections load balancing algorithm.
