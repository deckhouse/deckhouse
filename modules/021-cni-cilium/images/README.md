# Manual for building the `cni-cilium` module

## How it built

### Building `base_cilium_dev` images (used for build other images and binaries, and contain all dependencies)

- `base_cilium_dev` - contain all dependencies from original images: runtime, builder, compilers, cilium-envoy
  - based on `common/alt-p11-artifact` image
  - includes `(!!! loaded from internet)`:
    - packages from repo: p11
    - binaries of go (1.23.1) from `BASE_GOLANG_23_ALPINE` image
    - binaries and plugins of protoc (22.3) from github releases
    - binaries of bazel and wrapper shell-scripts from github releases
      - 3.7.0 3.7.1 3.7.2 6.3.2

### Building utility binaries

- `+` `hubble`
  - based on `BASE_GOLANG_23_ALPINE` image
  - includes:
    - src of hubble *(loaded from fox)*
    - binaries hubble-cli *(built from src)*

  - based on `base_cilium_dev` image
  - includes:
    - src of cilium/proxy *(loaded from fox)*
    - src of envoyproxy/envoy *(loaded from fox)*
    - build-cache of cilium/proxy *(loaded from fox)*
    - binaries and libs of cilium-envoy *(built from src)*

    - binaries from image `bpftool`
    - binaries from image `cni-plugins`
    - binaries from image `gops`

### Building an intermediate image for combining all binary files into one place and preparing the target file system

- `agent-binaries-artifact`
  - based on `base_cilium_dev` image
  - includes:
    - binaries from image `hubble`
    - binaries from image `llvm`
    - binaries from image `bpftool`
    - binaries from image `cni-plugins`
    - binaries from image `gops`
    - binaries and libs from image `iptables`
    - binaries and libs from image `cilium-envoy`
    - binaries, libs and scripts from image `cilium`
    - binaries for prepull: pause and true
    - prepared all binaries, libs and scripts what required for running cilium-agent and stored in separate dir

### Building final images (used in helm-templates)

- `agent-distroless` - the main image of cilium-agent
  - based on `distroless` image
  - includes prepared binaries, libs and scripts from image `agent-binaries-artifact`
- `operator` - the main image of cilium-operator
- `safe-agent-updater` - the image with an app that ensures the correct updating of cilium-agents
- `kube-rbac-proxy` - the image of kube-rbac-proxy modified for prepull
- `check-kernel-version` - the image of check-kernel-version modified for prepull

## How to search for target commits for image-tools

1. Cloning locally `https://github.com/cilium/image-tools` and go to it
2. You need to find the tag of the required image from original base dockerfiles (e.g. [here](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/v1.14.5/images/runtime/Dockerfile#L8-L10)) and write it to the `IMAGE_TAG` variable, for example

   ```shell
   IMAGE_TAG=a8c542efc076b62ba683e7699c0013adb6955f0f
   ```

3. Find all commits corresponding to this tag, for example

   ```shell
   git rev-list --all | git diff-tree --stdin --find-object=$IMAGE_TAG | grep -B1 -E "^:(\b\w+\b\s){3}$IMAGE_TAG"
   ```

4. And select the most recent one (by date)

## Original Building Container Images

In general, the original description is [here](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/v1.14.5/Documentation/contributing/development/images.rst) and [here](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.14/contributing/development/images/), but it may not be accurate

## original_build_way -> our_build_way

- All dependencies are collected in one image (`base_cilium_dev`)
- All "non-common" binaries and packages build from sources
- All common packages taken from ALTLinux
- All utility images are based on `base_cilium_dev` and are build in one pass (without complex multi-stage assemblies)
- Final image based on distroless
