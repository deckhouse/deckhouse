        `Kube-state-metrics` isn't working in the cluster.
      description: |-
        Deckhouse has detected that no metrics about cluster resources have been available for the past 5 minutes.
        As a result, most alerts and monitoring panels aren't working.

        Steps to troubleshoot:

        1. Check the `kube-state-metrics` pods:
        
           ```bash
           d8 k -n d8-monitoring describe pod -l app=kube-state-metrics
           ```

        2. Check the deployment logs:
        
           ```bash
           d8 k -n d8-monitoring describe deploy kube-state-metrics
           ```
