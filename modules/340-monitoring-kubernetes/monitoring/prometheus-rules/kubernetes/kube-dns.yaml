      description: |-
        Prometheus is unable to collect metrics from `kube-dns`, which makes its status unknown.

        Steps to troubleshoot:

        1. Check the deployment details:

           ```bash
           kubectl -n kube-system describe deployment -l k8s-app=kube-dns
           ```

        2. Check the pod details:

           ```bash
           kubectl -n kube-system describe pod -l k8s-app=kube-dns
           ```
