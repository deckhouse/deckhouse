{% alert %}
The functionality of the module is guaranteed only for stock kernels for distributions listed in the [list of supported OS](../../supported_versions.html#linux).
The functionality of the module with other kernels is possible but not guaranteed.
{% endalert %}

After enabling the module, the cluster is automatically configured to use LINSTOR, and all that remains is to configure the storage.

Some module functions may require a master passphrase (For example, remote S3 storage for backup purposes usage).  
To set a master passphrase, create a Secret in the `d8-system` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: linstor-passphrase
  namespace: d8-system
immutable: true
stringData:
  MASTER_PASSPHRASE: *!passphrase* # Master passphrase for LINSTOR
```

{% alert level="warning" %}
Choose a strong passphrase and store it securely. If it get lost, the encrypted data will be inaccessible.
{% endalert %}

## LINSTOR storage configuration

LINSTOR in Deckhouse can be configured by assigning special tag `linstor-<pool_name>` to an LVM volume group or LVMThin pool.

1. Choose the tag name.

   The tag name must be unique within the same node. Therefore, before assigning a new tag, make sure that other volume groups and thin pools do not have this tag already.

   Execute the following commands to get list volume groups and pools:

   ```shell
   # LVM pools
   vgs -o+tags | awk 'NR==1;$NF~/linstor-/'
   # LVMThin pools
   lvs -o+tags | awk 'NR==1;$NF~/linstor-/'
   ```

1. Add pools.

   Add pools on all nodes where you plan to store your data. Use the same names for the storage pools on the different nodes if you want to achieve a general StorageClasses created for all of them.

   - To add an **LVM** pool, create a volume group with the `linstor-<pool_name>` tag, or the `linstor-<pool_name>` tag to an existing volume group.

     Example of command to create a volume group `vg0` with the `linstor-data` tag :

     ```shell
     vgcreate vg0 /dev/nvme0n1 /dev/nvme1n1 --add-tag linstor-data
     ```

     Example of command to add the `linstor-data` tag to an existing volume group `vg0`:

     ```shell
     vgchange vg0 --add-tag linstor-data
     ```

   - To add an **LVMThin** pool, create a LVM thin pool with the `linstor-<pool_name>` tag.

     Example of command to create the LVMThin pool `vg0/thindata` with the `linstor-data` tag:

     ```shell
     vgcreate vg0 /dev/nvme0n1 /dev/nvme1n1
     lvcreate -l 100%FREE -T vg0/thindata --add-tag linstor-thindata
     ```

     > **Note!** The group itself should not have this tag configured.

1. Check the creation of StorageClass.

   Three new StorageClasses will appear when all the storage pools have been created. Check that they were created by running the following command in the Kubernetes cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl get storageclass
   ```

   Example of the output:

   ```shell
   $ kubectl get storageclass
   NAME                   PROVISIONER                  AGE
   linstor-data-r1        linstor.csi.linbit.com       143s
   linstor-data-r2        linstor.csi.linbit.com       142s
   linstor-data-r3        linstor.csi.linbit.com       142s
   ```

   Each StorageClass can be used to create volumes with one, two, or three replicas in your storage pools, respectively.

You can always refer to [Advanced LINSTOR Configuration](advanced_usage.html) if needed, but we strongly recommend sticking to this simplified guide.

## Additional features for your applications using LINSTOR storage

### Placing the application "closer" to the data (data locality)

In a hyperconverged infrastructure you may want your Pods to run on the same nodes as their data volumes, as it can help get the best performance from the storage.

The linstor module provides a custom kube-scheduler `linstor` for such tasks, that takes into account the placement of data in storage and tries to place Pod first on those nodes where data is available locally.

Any Pod using linstor volumes will be automatically configured to use the `linstor` scheduler.

### Application reschedule in case of node problem (storage-based fencing)

In case your application does not support high availability and runs in a single instance, you may want to force a migration from a node where problems occurred may arise. For example, if there are network issues, disk subsystem issues, etc.

The linstor module automatically removes the Pods from the node where the problem occurred (network or storage issues, etc.) and adds specfic taint on it that guarantees restarting pods on other healthy nodes in a cluster.
