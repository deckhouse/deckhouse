### 001-certificate_owner_ref.patch

Adds `CertificateOwnerRef` flag to Certificate CRD. `CertificateOwnerRef` flag is whether to set the certificate resource as an owner of a secret where the TLS certificate is stored. When this flag is enabled, the secret will be automatically removed when the certificate resource is deleted.
