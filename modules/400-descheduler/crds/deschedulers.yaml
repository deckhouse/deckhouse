                        This strategy finds nodes that are under utilized and evicts Pods from the nodes in the hope that these pods will be scheduled compactly into fewer nodes. When combined with node auto-scaling, it helps reduce the number of underutilized nodes. The strategy works with the `MostAllocated` scheduler.

                        > In GKE, you cannot configure the default scheduler, but you can use the `optimize-utilization` strategy or deploy a second custom scheduler.

                        Node resource usage takes into account [extended resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/extended-resource/) and is based on pod requests and limits, not actual consumption.
