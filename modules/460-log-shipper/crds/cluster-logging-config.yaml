                        Vector will keep pods metadata for this time as well to read logs from deleted pods.
                        This option is useful in cases of a log storage unavailability or a network partition. Vector will keep log files opened until finally sending them to the destination.

                        Enabling this option may affect the resource consumption of the Vector and also flood a disk with deleted logs. Use it with caution.

                        The format is a string containing the time unit in hours and minutes: 30m, 1h, 2h30m, 24h.

                        * `Backslash` — tries to match bash style logs with backslash on all lines except the last event line.
                        * `LogWithTime` — tries to detect events by timestamp.
                        * `MultilineJSON` — tries to match JSON logs, assuming the event starts with the `{` symbol.
                        * `Custom` - tries to match logs with the user provided regex in `spec.multilineParser.custom` field.
