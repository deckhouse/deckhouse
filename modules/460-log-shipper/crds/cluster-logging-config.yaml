                          * `Regex` — is trying to match regexp over the field; only log events with matching fields will pass.
                          * `NotRegex` — is a negative version of the `Regex` operator; log events without fields or with not matched fields will pass.
                          * `Exists` — drops log event if it contains some fields.
                          * `DoesNotExist` — drops log event if it does not contain some fields.
