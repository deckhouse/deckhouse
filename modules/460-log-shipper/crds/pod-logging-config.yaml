            Custom resource for namespaced Kubernetes source.

            Each custom resource `PodLoggingConfig` describes rules for log fetching from specified namespace.

                    Specifies the time to keep deleted files opened for reading.
                    Vector will keep pods metadata for this time as well to read logs from deleted pods.
                    This option is useful in cases of a log storage unavailability or a network partition. Vector will keep log files opened until finally sending them to the destination.

                    Enabling this option may affect the resource consumption of the Vector and also flood a disk with deleted logs. Use it with caution.

                    The format is a string containing the time unit in hours and minutes: 30m, 1h, 2h30m, 24h.
