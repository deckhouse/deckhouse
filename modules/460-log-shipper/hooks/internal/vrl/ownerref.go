// by a replica set with this hash (this is due to avoid replicset names collisions).
//
// Pods, created by the cronjob controller, always owned by a job with a name ended with numbers.
// These numbers are a hash of a time stamp when the job should be executed
// (to avoid executing job twice at the same time).
