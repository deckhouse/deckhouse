            Provides a resource for creating snapshots of existing virtual disks, which can be used as data sources for generating new virtual disks.

            When running, a VolumeSnapshot resource is created.

                    Create a snapshot of a connected virtual machine's disk only if it is possible to freeze the machine through the agent.

                    If set to `True`, a virtual disk snapshot will be created when at least one of the following conditions is met:
                    - The virtual disk is not connected to any virtual machine.
                    - The virtual disk is connected to a powered-off virtual machine.
                    - The virtual disk is connected to a virtual machine with an agent, and the freeze operation was successful.
