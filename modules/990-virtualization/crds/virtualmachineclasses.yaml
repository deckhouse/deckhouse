                        * `Host`: Uses a virtual CPU with an instruction set closely matching the platform node's CPU.
                        This provides high performance and functionality, as well as compatibility with "live" migration for nodes with similar processor types.
                        For example, VM migration between nodes with Intel and AMD processors will not work.
                        This is also true for different CPU generations, as their instruction set is different.
                        * `HostPassthrough`: Uses the platform node's physical CPU directly, without any modifications.
                        When using this class, the guest VM can only be transferred to a target node with a CPU exactly matching the source node's CPU.
                        * `Discovery`: Create a virtual CPU based on instruction sets of physical CPUs for a selected set of nodes.
                        * `Model`: CPU model. A CPU model is a named and previously defined set of supported CPU instructions.
                        * `Features`: A required set of supported instructions for the CPU.
