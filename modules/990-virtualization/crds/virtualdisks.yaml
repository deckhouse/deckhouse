            The VirtualDisk resource describes the desired virtual machine disk configuration. A VirtualDisk can be mounted statically in the virtual machine by specifying it in the `.spec.blockDeviceRefs` disk list, or mounted on-the-fly using the VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachments resource.

            Once a VirtualDisk is created, only the disk size field `.spec.persistentVolumeClaim.size` can be changed. All other fields are immutable.

                        StorageClass name required by the claim. For details on using StorageClass for PVC, refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1.

                        When creating disks, the user can specify the required StorageClass. If not specified, the default StorageClass will be used.

                        The disk features and virtual machine behavior depend on the selected StorageClass.

                        The `VolumeBindingMode` parameter in the StorageClass affects the disk creation process. The following values are allowed:
                        - `Immediate`: The disk will be created and becomes available for use immediately after creation.
                        - `WaitForFirstConsumer`: The disk will be created when first used on the node where the virtual machine will be started.

                        StorageClass supports multiple storage settings:
                        - Creating a block device (`Block`) or file system (`FileSystem`).
                        - Multiple access (`ReadWriteMany`) or single access (`ReadWriteOnce`). The `ReadWriteMany` disks support multiple access, which enables a "live" migration of virtual machines. In contrast, the `ReadWriteOnce` disks, which can be accessed from only one node, don't have this feature.

                        For known storage types, Deckhouse automatically determines the most efficient settings when creating disks (by priority, in descending order):
                        1. `Block` + `ReadWriteMany`
                        2. `FileSystem` + `ReadWriteMany`
                        3. `Block` + `ReadWriteOnce`
