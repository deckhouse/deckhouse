                    Pay attention to the following nuances if this module is used together with the [user-authn](/modulesuser-authn/) module:
                    - Use the user's `email` as the username to grant privileges to the specific user;
                    - When specifying a group, make sure that the necessary groups are allowed to be received from the provider, i.e., they are defined in the corresponding custom resource [DexProvider](/modulesuser-authn/cr.html#dexprovider).
