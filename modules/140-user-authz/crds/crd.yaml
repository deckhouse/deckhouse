                    Access level:
                    * `User` — has access to information about all objects (including viewing pod logs) but cannot exec into containers, read secrets, and perform port-forwarding;
                    * `PrivilegedUser` — the same as `User` + can exec into containers, read secrets, and delete pods (and thus, restart them);
                    * `Editor` — is the same as `PrivilegedUser` + can create and edit namespaces and all objects that are usually required for application tasks;

                      **Caution!** since `Editor` can edit `RoleBindings`, he can broader his privileges within the namespace;
                    * `Admin` — the same as `Editor` + can delete service objects (auxiliary resources such as `ReplicaSet`, `certmanager.k8s.io/challenges`, and `certmanager.k8s.io/orders`);
                    * `ClusterEditor` — the same as `Editor` + can manage a limited set of cluster-wide objects that can be used in application tasks (`ClusterXXXMetric`, `ClusterRoleBindings`, `KeepalivedInstance`, `DaemonSet`, etc.). This role is best suited for cluster operators.

                      **Caution!** since `ClusterEditor` can edit `ClusterRoleBindings`, he can broader his privileges within the cluster;
                    * `ClusterAdmin` — the same as both `ClusterEditor` and `Admin` + can manage cluster-wide service objects (e.g.,  MachineSets, Machines, OpenstackInstanceClasses..., as well as ClusterAuthorizationRule). This role is best suited for cluster administrators.

                      **Caution!** since `ClusterAdmin` can edit `ClusterRoleBindings`, he can broader his privileges within the cluster;
                    * `SuperAdmin` — can perform any actions with any objects (note that `limitNamespaces` (see below) restrictions remain valid).

                    * If the list is not defined, then all namespaces are accessible (except for the system ones - see `spec.allowAccessToSystemNamespaces` below).

                    Pay attention to the following nuances if this module is used together with the [user-authn](https://deckhouse.io/en/documentation/v1/modules/150-user-authn/) module:
                    - Use the user's `email` as the username to grant privileges to the specific user;
                    - When specifying a group, make sure that the necessary groups are allowed to be received from the provider, i.e., they are defined in the corresponding custom resource [DexProvider](https://deckhouse.io/en/documentation/v1/modules/150-user-authn/cr.html#dexprovider).
